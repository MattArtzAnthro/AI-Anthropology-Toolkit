# AI Anthropology Toolkit

*Advancing AI Anthropology through computational approaches to qualitative research*

## 🎯 Overview

The **AI Anthropology Toolkit** is a suite of computational anthropology tools designed to enhance qualitative research methods. Rather than replacing the interpretive work that defines anthropological inquiry, these tools address the practical challenges of scale in contemporary research contexts while maintaining methodological rigor.

This toolkit represents a **computational anthropology** approach—using AI to augment rather than automate the nuanced work of qualitative analysis. Each tool preserves the critical thinking and contextual understanding that makes anthropological research valuable while dramatically reducing the time-intensive manual processes that can limit research scope.

## 🧠 What is AI Anthropology?

AI Anthropology is an emerging field that combines:
- **Studying AI as cultural artifact** - Understanding how AI systems reflect and shape human culture
- **Using AI to enhance ethnographic research** - Leveraging computational methods to scale qualitative analysis
- **Applying anthropological insights to AI development** - Bringing cultural understanding to technology design

This toolkit focuses on the second aspect: using AI to enhance traditional anthropological research methods while preserving the interpretive frameworks that make our discipline unique.

## 🛠️ Current Tools

### 1. [Interview Transcript Semantic Chunker](https://github.com/MattArtzAnthro/Interview_Transcript_Semantic_Chunker)
**Purpose**: Transform lengthy interview transcripts into semantically coherent chunks for systematic analysis.

**Key Features**:
- Multi-format support (PDF, DOCX, TXT, RTF)
- Ethnographically-aware chunking that preserves speaker labels and conversation structure
- AI-powered segmentation using Claude API or local sentence transformers
- Quality metrics and validation
- Export ready for qualitative coding software (NVivo, ATLAS.ti)

**Best for**: Preparing interview data for systematic coding and analysis

### 2. [Qualitative Codebook Builder](https://github.com/MattArtzAnthro/Qualitative_Codebook_Builder)
**Purpose**: AI-assisted development of qualitative coding frameworks.

**Key Features**:
- Theory-driven code generation from research questions and literature
- Code definitions with inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Multiple examples per code for consistency
- Export formats compatible with analysis software
- Iterative refinement capabilities

**Best for**: Developing robust deductive coding frameworks before analysis

### 3. [Coding and Thematic Analysis](https://github.com/MattArtzAnthro/Coding_and_Thematic_Analysis)
**Purpose**: Apply codes to qualitative data and build themes using both deductive and inductive approaches.

**Key Features**:
- Deductive coding using predefined codebooks
- Inductive coding to discover emergent themes
- Hybrid approaches combining both methods
- Automated theme building from coded data
- Visualizations and network analysis
- Professional export formats (Excel, Word)

**Best for**: Systematic coding of qualitative data and thematic analysis

## 🔄 Integrated Workflow

The toolkit is designed as an integrated workflow for qualitative analysis:
