description: >
  Develop, refine, and stress-test anthropological research questions. Use this
  skill whenever a user mentions research questions, RQs, dissertation questions,
  proposal questions, or asks for help formulating what they want to study. Also
  trigger when users say things like "I want to study X," "how do I narrow my
  topic," "is this question too broad," "help me write my research question,"
  "I'm writing a proposal and need questions," or "what should I be asking."
  Covers sociocultural, linguistic, archaeological, biological, medical, applied,
  and design anthropology as well as cognate qualitative social sciences. Works
  across genres: journal articles, dissertation proposals, grant applications
  (NSF, Wenner-Gren, Fulbright), and applied/consulting projects. If someone is
  working on any pre-fieldwork intellectual framing task, this skill applies.

# Research Question Development & Refinement

Helps anthropologists formulate, evaluate, and iteratively refine research
questions that are theoretically grounded, empirically tractable, ethically
reflexive, and calibrated to their target genre and audience.

## Quick Reference

| Task | Reference |
|------|-----------|
| Question grammar, templates, and subfield examples | Read [references/question-grammar.md](references/question-grammar.md) |
| Evaluation rubric and stress-testing | Read [references/evaluation-rubric.md](references/evaluation-rubric.md) |
| Genre-specific conventions (journals, proposals, grants) | Read [references/genre-conventions.md](references/genre-conventions.md) |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify What the User Needs

Determine where the user is in the question development process. There are three
common entry points:

1. **From scratch.** The user has a topic, site, or puzzle but no formulated
   question yet. They need the full drafting workflow.
2. **Refinement.** The user has a draft question (or several) and wants feedback,
   sharpening, or restructuring. They need evaluation and iteration.
3. **Genre adaptation.** The user has a working question and needs to adapt it
   for a specific output — a grant narrative, a dissertation prospectus, an
   article introduction. They need genre-specific formatting guidance.

If the entry point is ambiguous, ask one clarifying question. Do not ask more
than two questions before producing something the user can react to — a draft
question, a diagnostic, or a set of options. Anthropologists think through
writing, not through intake forms.

### Step 2: Gather Context

Collect the following, either from the user's message or by asking:

**Always needed:**
- **Topic or phenomenon** — what they want to understand
- **Conceptual lever** — what theoretical tension, debate, or concept animates
  the inquiry (if the user doesn't have one yet, help them find it)
- **Empirical setting** — where, when, with whom, through what materials

**Needed if available (don't block on these):**
- **Epistemic stance** — their primary orientation. See the parameter list below.
  Most researchers work at intersections; identify the primary stance and note
  combinatory possibilities. If the user doesn't name a stance, infer from their
  language and confirm.
- **Genre** — what document this question will appear in (article, proposal,
  grant application, prospectus)
- **Field configuration** — single site, multi-sited, digital, archival, hybrid,
  comparative
- **Career stage** — this affects how ambitious and complex the question set
  should be (a first-year PhD student needs a more bounded question than a
  senior scholar)

### Step 3: Draft the Research Question

Read [references/question-grammar.md](references/question-grammar.md) before
drafting.

Apply the five-slot grammar:

> **Phenomenon + Process + Conceptual lever + Situated context + Answer-form**

Strong anthropological research questions share these properties:

- They name a **relational process**, not just a thing. "How do X negotiate Y"
  rather than "What is X."
- They contain a **conceptual tension** — a reason the answer matters beyond the
  case. The question should imply what theoretical conversation it joins.
- They specify **empirical traction** — a reader should be able to imagine what
  data would answer this question.
- They imply an **answer-form** without predetermining the answer. "What does X
  reveal about Y" implies analytical scaling; "How do X manage Y" implies
  process documentation.
- They are **robust to renegotiation** — phrased so that if access shifts,
  consent is renegotiated, or conditions change, the core intellectual problem
  survives with a modified empirical strategy.

For most projects, produce a **question set**: one governing question plus 2–4
subsidiary questions. The governing question states the theoretical problem. The
subsidiary questions operationalize it across specific domains, scales, or
evidence types.

Avoid these anti-patterns:
- **Performative self-reference**: "In this study, I explore..." Journals
  discourage this; state the question directly.
- **Case-only framing**: "What is life like in X?" without a conceptual lever
  that connects to broader debates.
- **Vague temporality**: "recently," "in the modern era." Use bounded time
  references or explain why temporal openness is analytically justified.
- **Extraction framing**: "How do I get participants to talk about X?" Reframe
  toward the conditions under which people find it safe, meaningful, or
  beneficial to engage.
- **Laundry lists**: More than 5 sub-questions usually signals scope inflation.
  Each question should map to a distinct evidence type or analytical move.

### Step 4: Evaluate and Stress-Test

Read [references/evaluation-rubric.md](references/evaluation-rubric.md) before
evaluating.

Run the draft question set through the scope-feasibility matrix:

| Dimension | Check |
|-----------|-------|
| Population / unit | Is it bounded? Is access realistic? |
| Time | Is the temporal frame explicit and justified? |
| Mechanism | Do the verbs specify process, not just "affect" or "impact"? |
| Evidence | Can you name 2–3 data types that would answer this? |
| Ethics | Are obligations, consent, and governance built into the question's assumptions? |
| Contingency | Does the question survive a "Plan B" scenario? |
| Genre fit | Can this be expressed in a title + abstract for the target venue? |

Apply the seven-criterion rubric (detailed in the reference file) and provide
a candid assessment. Flag the weakest criterion and suggest a specific repair.

### Step 5: Iterate

Present the evaluated question set with:

1. The questions themselves, clearly formatted
2. A brief rationale for the governing question's theoretical contribution
3. One specific strength and one specific weakness
4. A concrete revision suggestion for the weakest element

If the user wants to continue refining, return to Step 3 with updated context.
Each iteration should visibly improve on the identified weakness.

### Step 6: Genre Formatting (if applicable)

If the user needs the question set formatted for a specific output, read
[references/genre-conventions.md](references/genre-conventions.md) and adapt:

- **Journal article**: Embed the governing question in a problem-framing
  introduction. Sub-questions structure sections but are usually not enumerated.
  Calibrate to word limits (typically 7,500–11,000 words for sociocultural
  journals).
- **Dissertation proposal**: Enumerate questions explicitly. Map each to data
  types, methods, and a feasibility argument. Include contingency language.
- **Grant application**: Lead with the governing question as the intellectual
  hook. Map sub-questions to a work plan and timeline. Address "broader impacts"
  or equivalent.
- **Applied / consulting proposal**: Lead with the problem the client cares
  about. Translate the research question into actionable inquiry without
  stripping theoretical depth.

## Parameters

- **Epistemic stance** (select primary; may combine):
  Interpretive, Phenomenological, Hermeneutic, Ontological, Critical, Political
  economy / Marxian, Critical race, Critical medical, Postcolonial, Feminist,
  Queer theory, Decolonial, Indigenous methodologies, STS / actor-network,
  Multispecies / more-than-human, Infrastructure studies, Environmental /
  political ecology, Practice theory, Performance / performativity, Cognitive,
  Psychological, Linguistic, Semiotic, Applied / evaluation, Design anthropology,
  Business / organizational, Public / engaged, Mixed-methods, Computational /
  digital, Visual / sensory, Historical / archival, Multi-sited, Structuralist /
  post-structuralist, Psychoanalytic, Narrative / life history, Affect theory,
  Material culture / object-oriented, Economic anthropology, Legal / rights-based,
  Medical / health (interpretive), Migration / mobility studies, Anarchist /
  anti-authoritarian.

- **Genre**: Journal article, dissertation proposal, grant application (NSF,
  Wenner-Gren, Fulbright), MA thesis, applied/consulting proposal.

- **Compression**: 1-sentence governing question, full question set with
  rationale, 150-word abstract-ready version.

- **Field configuration**: Single site, multi-sited, digital, archival, hybrid,
  comparative.

- **Risk posture**: Low-risk, vulnerable populations, high-surveillance,
  politically sensitive. Higher risk postures demand that the question
  explicitly address consent, governance, and harm.

- **Formality register**: Working draft (informal, exploratory), committee-ready
  (polished, defensible), publication-ready (journal conventions applied).

## Guardrails

- **Ethics as design, not appendix.** Every question set produced by this skill
  must have ethics and obligations legible in the question's framing. If a
  question implies extractive access (e.g., "How do I get participants to reveal
  X"), flag it and suggest a relational reframing. This is not optional.

- **No overclaiming.** The skill should not produce questions that promise more
  than a single researcher or project can deliver. If the question set implies a
  scope that exceeds the stated career stage, timeline, or resources, flag it.

- **Epistemic humility in output.** When drafting questions, use language that
  invites discovery rather than confirms hypotheses, unless the user's
  methodological tradition explicitly works with hypotheses (e.g., some
  biocultural, archaeological, and mixed-methods approaches).

- **Refuse to flatten complexity.** If a user asks for "one simple question" but
  their project clearly involves multiple scales, populations, or evidence types,
  explain why a question set serves them better and offer one — while still
  providing the single governing question they asked for.

- **Positionality as method, not confession.** When positionality is relevant to
  the question (it usually is), embed it as a methodological commitment within
  the question's framing (what access is assumed, what relations are
  foregrounded, what harms are anticipated), not as a separate confessional
  paragraph.

## Common Failure Modes

**Generic social science output.** The most common failure is producing questions
that read like generic qualitative research rather than anthropological inquiry.
Anthropological questions are distinguished by attention to cultural specificity,
relational processes, power dynamics, reflexivity, and theoretical engagement
with disciplinary debates. If the output could appear unchanged in a sociology,
public health, or education methods textbook, it is not anthropological enough.
Check that the question names a cultural or relational process, not just a
variable or outcome.

**All theory, no traction.** Questions that are purely conceptual without
empirical anchoring — "How does neoliberalism shape subjectivity?" — are not
research questions; they are seminar prompts. Every question needs a where, a
when, a who or what, and an implied evidence form.

**All site, no stakes.** The inverse: questions that describe a location and a
population but don't say why anyone beyond area specialists should care. "What
are the everyday practices of X community?" needs a conceptual lever.

**Overfit to one stance.** If the user's project sits at the intersection of two
stances (e.g., feminist + STS), the question should reflect both, not default
to one. Ask which is primary and which is secondary.

## Examples

**Example 1: From scratch, sociocultural, dissertation proposal**

Input: "I want to study how gig workers in Jakarta think about their future.
I'm a second-year PhD student interested in precarity and aspiration."

Output approach:
- Identify epistemic stance: likely interpretive with political economy
  inflections (precarity literature). Confirm with user.
- Read question-grammar.md for the mechanism-in-context template.
- Draft governing question: "How do gig platform workers in Jakarta construct
  viable futures under conditions of structural precarity, and what does their
  temporal reasoning reveal about the limits of aspiration as an analytical
  category?"
- Draft 2–3 subsidiary questions mapping to distinct evidence types
  (interviews, platform interfaces, household economies).
- Stress-test against the rubric. Flag feasibility (access to gig workers,
  platform data) and ethics (precarious populations, surveillance risk from
  platform employers).
- Format for dissertation prospectus genre: enumerate questions, map to methods,
  include contingency.

**Example 2: Refinement, linguistic anthropology, journal article**

Input: "My research question is 'How does language affect identity among
immigrants?' but my advisor says it's too broad. This is for a journal article."

Output approach:
- Diagnose: vague temporality ("immigrants" where?), mechanism verb too generic
  ("affect"), no conceptual lever beyond "identity."
- Ask: What specific population, what linguistic practices, what theoretical
  conversation about identity?
- Read question-grammar.md for the concept-revision template.
- Draft refined version: "How do Haitian Creole speakers in Miami mobilize
  code-switching across workplace, religious, and domestic settings, and what do
  these register shifts reveal about competing models of belonging in
  post-TPS-extension uncertainty?"
- Evaluate against genre conventions: fits within a single article's scope,
  implies specific interactional data, connects to active debates in linguistic
  anthropology (language ideologies, register, belonging).

**Example 3: Genre adaptation, applied anthropology, Wenner-Gren application**

Input: "I have my questions for my dissertation but now I need to write them
into a Wenner-Gren application. Here they are: [questions provided]."

Output approach:
- Read genre-conventions.md for Wenner-Gren conventions.
- Evaluate questions against the rubric to identify strengths and weaknesses
  before reformatting.
- Reformat: lead with the governing question as the intellectual hook in the
  project description. Map sub-questions to methodology and timeline. Ensure
  the "broader ethics" framing (obligations, debts, descendant considerations)
  is explicit, as Wenner-Gren expects this. Include contingency / Plan B
  language.
- Flag any scope issues relative to the fellowship's timeline and budget.
