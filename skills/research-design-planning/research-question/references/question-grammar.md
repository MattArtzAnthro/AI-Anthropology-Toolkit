# Research Question Grammar and Templates

This reference provides the structural grammar, question-family templates, and
subfield-adapted examples for drafting anthropological research questions.

## The Five-Slot Grammar

Every strong anthropological research question can be read as a structured
proposition with five slots:

```
Phenomenon + Process + Conceptual lever + Situated context + Answer-form
```

A compact template:

> How/why/when does **[process]** shape **[phenomenon/outcome]** through
> **[mechanism or conceptual tension]** in **[field site/population/material
> domain]**, and what would count as evidence of that shaping?

Not every question uses this template verbatim. Some are more economical, some
more layered. But the five slots should be recoverable from any well-formed
question. If a slot is missing, the question probably has a structural weakness.

### Slot Details

**Phenomenon**: What is being studied. Not a generic topic ("identity,"
"health") but a specific cultural form, practice, relation, or problem.
Specificity here prevents scope inflation.

**Process**: The relational verb. This is where anthropological questions
distinguish themselves from survey research. Favor process verbs that imply
culturally specific action: *negotiate, translate, classify, maintain, refuse,
reconfigure, domesticate, enact, circulate, contest.* Avoid: *affect, impact,
influence* (too vague to imply mechanism).

**Conceptual lever**: The theoretical reason the question matters beyond the
case. This slot connects the question to a disciplinary debate, concept, or
tension. It is what makes the question anthropological rather than journalistic.
Examples: "moral economies of risk," "the limits of aspiration as an analytical
category," "competing models of belonging."

**Situated context**: Where, when, with/among whom, through what materials.
This slot provides empirical traction — a reader should be able to imagine what
fieldwork or archival work would answer this question. Temporal bounding matters:
use specific dates or periods, not "recently" or "in the modern era."

**Answer-form**: What kind of answer the question anticipates without
predetermining it. "What does X reveal about Y" implies analytical scaling from
case to concept. "How do X manage Y" implies process documentation. "Under what
conditions does X occur" implies comparative or conditional logic. This slot
disciplines the inquiry without closing it.

## Question Set Structure

Most projects need a question set, not a single question:

- **Governing question** (1): States the theoretical problem. This is the
  question the project ultimately answers. It should be expressible in a
  title and an abstract.
- **Subsidiary questions** (2–4): Operationalize the governing question across
  specific domains, scales, evidence types, or analytical moves. Each should
  map to a distinct data source or method. More than 4 sub-questions usually
  signals scope inflation.

The governing question sets the intellectual stakes. The subsidiary questions
make the project doable. The relationship between them should be non-redundant:
each sub-question illuminates a different facet of the governing question, and
together they constitute a complete (but not exhaustive) response.

## Question-Family Templates

Use the template that best fits the project's analytical logic. These are
starting points, not rigid forms.

### Mechanism-in-Context

When the goal is causal or process explanation without experimental control.

> How do **[actors]** produce **[outcome]** through **[practice/mechanism]**
> under **[conditions]**?

Typical evidence: ethnographic observation + interviews + institutional/archival
traces.

Best for: sociocultural studies of how things get done, maintained, or
transformed in practice.

### Comparative Ethnography

When variation across sites, groups, or time periods is theoretically
productive.

> How does **[phenomenon]** differ across **[sites/groups/time periods]**, and
> what does that difference reveal about **[concept]**?

Typical evidence: multi-sited data with a structured comparison plan.

Best for: multi-sited ethnography, cross-cultural comparison, historical change.

### Concept Revision

When the goal is to refine, challenge, or extend a theoretical concept through
ethnographic pressure.

> What does **[ethnographic situation]** force us to rethink about
> **[concept/debate]**, and with what implications beyond the case?

Typical evidence: "ethnography-to-theory" linkage with explicit scaling-up from
particular to general.

Best for: projects where the primary contribution is theoretical, grounded in a
specific case.

### Measurement and Prediction

When evaluating models, classifications, or predictive performance — common in
archaeology, biocultural, and computational anthropology.

> How accurately does **[model/protocol]** predict/classify **[X]** in
> **[context]**, and which variables drive error?

Typical evidence: quantitative evaluation + metadata + contextual
interpretation.

Best for: archaeological predictive modeling, forensic anthropology, biometric
assessment, computational approaches.

### Ethics-Forward Design

When harms, consent, data governance, or descendant relations are central to the
inquiry itself (not just a compliance requirement).

> What obligations arise for **[researcher/institution]** in studying
> **[people/remains/data]**, and how will the project structure benefit,
> consent, control, and future use?

Typical evidence: ethics protocol as data, consultation documentation,
governance agreements.

Best for: Indigenous methodologies, NAGPRA-related research, community-based
participatory research, digital ethics, research involving vulnerable
populations.

### Ideology-Practice

Common in linguistic anthropology and linguistic ethnography.

> What **[ideologies/beliefs/frameworks]** are institutionalized in
> **[setting]**, and what **[interactional/discursive practices]** do
> participants enact across **[specified sites of interaction]**?

Typical evidence: discourse analysis, interactional data, institutional texts,
multi-setting observation.

Best for: linguistic anthropology, institutional ethnography, studies of
language and power.

## Subfield Adaptations

The five-slot grammar applies across subfields, but emphasis and conventions
shift. Below are notes on how different subfields typically weight the slots.

### Sociocultural Anthropology

The conceptual lever carries the most weight. Questions must join a theoretical
conversation — "applying concept X to case Y" is insufficient unless the
application revises or extends the concept. Temporality matters: specify change
over time or explain why a synchronic frame is analytically justified.

### Linguistic Anthropology

Typically separates ideology from practice in the question structure. Forces
multi-sited data collection by specifying multiple interaction settings. Implies
discourse-analytic evidence and institutional texts alongside interactional data.

### Archaeology

Uses explicit comparators and defines outcomes in terms of prediction,
chronology, or pattern identification. Variable lists (terrain, vegetation,
hydrological, taphonomic) are often part of the question itself. Questions must
be explicit enough to justify disturbance, sampling, and curation commitments.

### Biological / Physical Anthropology

Often mixes "what" (mechanisms) with "how" (inference practices). Emphasizes
standards, protocols, and uncertainty quantification. Makes the theoretical
framework explicit and links method to inference, not only to technique.

### Applied / Design Anthropology

Makes the unit of action explicit (policy, program, intervention, design
process). Includes beneficiary and responsibility language. Often requires
stakeholder definitions of the problem alongside the researcher's framing.

### Medical Anthropology

Navigates between biomedical and interpretive frameworks. Questions typically
specify whose definitions of health, illness, or care are at stake. Critical
medical anthropology questions foreground structural determinants; interpretive
medical anthropology questions foreground illness narratives and meaning-making.

## Combining Epistemic Stances

Most researchers work at intersections. When a project combines stances, the
question should reflect the combination explicitly:

- Name the primary stance and indicate secondary inflections
- The conceptual lever should draw from the primary stance's theoretical
  vocabulary
- Subsidiary questions can map to different stances within the combination
  (e.g., one sub-question focused on political economy, another on
  phenomenological experience)

Example of a combined question (feminist + STS):

> How do women scientists in Indian pharmaceutical labs navigate gendered
> knowledge hierarchies within laboratory practices, and what does their
> experience reveal about how epistemic authority is produced at the
> intersection of gender, caste, and technoscientific expertise?

The governing question combines feminist attention to gendered power with STS
attention to knowledge production and epistemic authority. Subsidiary questions
might operationalize each dimension separately.

## Verbs That Work (and Verbs to Avoid)

### Process Verbs (prefer these)

negotiate, translate, classify, maintain, refuse, reconfigure, domesticate,
enact, circulate, contest, produce, mobilize, mediate, navigate, constitute,
perform, generate, sustain, disrupt, manage, rework, curate, articulate,
broker, inhabit, cultivate, withdraw from, remake

### Vague Verbs (avoid or specify)

affect, impact, influence, shape (unless you specify how), relate to, deal
with, experience (unless phenomenological), interact with (unless you specify
the mode of interaction)

The difference: process verbs imply a mechanism; vague verbs defer the
analytical work to later. If you find yourself using a vague verb, ask: "What
specific action or practice am I actually pointing to?"
