## Program Overview

The Fulbright U.S. Student Program funds U.S. citizens to conduct study or
research abroad. Study/Research applicants design their own projects and
typically work with advisers at foreign universities or other institutions
of higher education. Awards are available in approximately 140 countries.

**Key difference from NSF/Wenner-Gren:** Fulbright is fundamentally a
cultural exchange program administered by the U.S. Department of State.
The research project matters, but mutual understanding, community engagement,
and cultural exchange are equally central to the evaluation. This shapes
every aspect of the application.

**Eligibility:**
- U.S. citizens
- Must hold a bachelor's degree by the award start date
- Must not hold a PhD at time of application
- Currently enrolled students apply through their institution's Fulbright
  Program Adviser (FPA)
- Non-enrolled applicants with ≤7 years professional experience may apply
  (more experience → consider the Fulbright Scholar Program instead)

**Award benefits:** Monthly living stipend, health benefits, round-trip
airfare. Some country-specific awards include tuition coverage for degree
programs. Exact benefits vary by country.

**Competition cycle:** The 2027–2028 competition opens in Spring 2026.
Applications go through campus review (if enrolled), then national screening,
then host country selection. Final decisions released on a rolling basis
March–June.

## Before You Begin: Country-Specific Requirements

**This is critical.** Program requirements vary significantly by country.
Before writing any application content, the user must:

1. Review the **country program summary** at
   https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries
2. Determine whether the country accepts **independent research proposals,**
   **graduate degree enrollment,** or both
3. Note any **field restrictions, language requirements,** or preferred
   research areas for that country
4. Identify whether there are **named/special awards** for that country
   (some countries have field-specific awards with different requirements)

Ask the user: "Which country are you applying to?" and "Have you reviewed
the country program summary?" If they haven't, pause and direct them to
the country page before proceeding.

## Application Components

### 1. Project Information

- **Field of Study:** Select from drop-down (closest match)
- **Project Title:** ≤90 characters. Succinct, clearly introduces the project.
  (Listed in the public Grantee Directory if awarded.)
- **Abstract/Summary:** ≤1,750 characters. Concise description of the what,
  where, and why of the project. If proposing a graduate degree, summarize
  the program and relevance to career/education plans.

### 2. Statement of Grant Purpose (≤6,000 characters including spaces)

This is the core of the application. It outlines the **Who, What, When,
Where, Why, and How** of the proposed project.

**Critical formatting constraint:** 6,000 characters (roughly 2 pages) is
extremely tight. Every character matters. No bibliographies, publications,
or citations except what fits within the character limit.

For independent research projects, address:

- **What** is the research question/project? What will you investigate?
- **Why** does this project matter? What contribution will it make?
- **Where** will you conduct the research? Why this specific location?
- **When** will you carry out the project? Include a feasible timeline.
- **How** will you conduct the research? What methods will you use?
- **Who** are your host country contacts/affiliations?
- **How** will the project contribute to the Fulbright goal of promoting
  cultural exchange and mutual understanding?
- **How** will you engage with the host country community? Give specific
  ideas for civic engagement.

For graduate degree proposals, focus on:
- Why you want to pursue the program in this country
- Reasons for selecting the particular institution
- Relevance to career/education plans

**Writing guidance from Fulbright:**
- Be clear and concise. Avoid discipline-specific jargon.
- The application must be understandable by a **general audience** (unlike
  NSF/Wenner-Gren which expect disciplinary expertise from reviewers).
- Organize carefully — do not make reviewers search for information.
- Get feedback from a faculty adviser, someone outside your discipline,
  a fellow student, and/or the campus Fulbright Program Adviser.

### 3. Personal Statement (separate from Grant Purpose)

The Personal Statement answers "Why you?" while the Grant Purpose answers
"What you propose to do." The Personal Statement should:

- Open with an engaging hook — narrative quality, powerful anecdote or vivid
  memory related to your passion or research topic
- Highlight salient aspects of personal identity that connect to the project
  (family background, experiences, heritage, cultural identity)
- Avoid clichés, stereotypes, savior narratives
- Not repeat facts from the biographical data section
- Complement the Statement of Grant Purpose without duplicating it

### 4. Affiliation

Fulbright requires an appropriate host-country affiliation (university,
research institute, etc.). This is the applicant's responsibility to
identify, contact, and secure. IIE/Fulbright staff cannot help.

For research-heavy proposals, the applicant **must have host country
contacts** that can support the research, provide access to resources,
and/or advise during the grant period.

Strategies for identifying affiliations:
- Faculty connections at home campus
- International students/scholars at home institution
- Conference contacts
- Published scholars whose work intersects with the project

### 5. Foreign Language Evaluation

Required for countries where the language of the host country is necessary
for the project. Requirements vary by country — check the program summary.

### 6. Recommendations (3 required)

Recommenders should receive copies of the Statement of Grant Purpose and
Short Answers. Give recommenders 4–5 weeks. Register them in the online
system for direct upload.

### 7. Transcripts

Complete academic record from all undergraduate and graduate institutions
from which degrees were received. Transcripts also required from other
institutions where 12+ credits were earned (if not reflected as transfers).

### 8. Human Subjects

If the project involves human research subjects, applicants must note this.
IRB approval is not required at application time, but funded grantees must
comply with all ethical requirements before commencing research.

## Evaluation Criteria

Initial screening is based on three categories:

### 1. Quality and Feasibility of the Proposal

- Plan, timeline, and methodology of the proposed project
- Appropriate in-country affiliation and resources
- Strong connection between proposed project and host country

### 2. Academic and/or Professional Record

- Relevant training, accomplishments, extracurricular activities
- Language preparation (if required)

### 3. Ambassadorial and Engagement Potential

- Extent to which the candidate and project advance Fulbright's aim of
  promoting mutual understanding among nations
- Engagement in the host community
- Preference factors established by the Fulbright Foreign Scholarship
  Board and in-country Commissions

**The ambassadorial dimension is not optional.** A technically excellent
research proposal that does not demonstrate community engagement and
cultural exchange potential will be weaker than one that does.

## Key Differences from NSF and Wenner-Gren

| Dimension | NSF DDRIG | Wenner-Gren | Fulbright |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Primary purpose | Advance basic science | Advance anthropological knowledge | Cultural exchange + research/study |
| Review audience | Disciplinary experts | Disciplinary experts (anonymous) | Mixed: disciplinary + general audience |
| Language | Technical, discipline-specific acceptable | Disciplinary with broader accessibility | Must be accessible to general audience |
| Theory requirement | Falsifiable hypotheses; theory-testing | Theoretically driven; well-defined question | "Contribution" framing; feasibility and engagement matter as much |
| Cultural exchange | Not evaluated | Not evaluated | Core evaluation criterion |
| Community engagement | Under "broader impacts" | Under ethics (Q5) and contribution (Q6) | Explicit, specific, required |
| Length | 10 single-spaced pages | 6 questions × 500–1,000 words each | 6,000 characters (~2 pages) |
| Budget | $25K direct + indirect | $25K total | Set by country program (stipend, airfare, benefits) |
| Anonymity | Not anonymous | Double anonymous | Not anonymous |
| Personal narrative | Positionality statement | Q4 (why you) | Separate Personal Statement required |

## Adapting Anthropological Research for Fulbright

### Register shift

The biggest adaptation from a committee prospectus or NSF proposal is
**register.** Fulbright reviewers include non-specialists. Anthropological
jargon ("ontological turn," "assemblage," "entanglement," "biosociality")
must be translated into accessible language. This does not mean dumbing
down — it means explaining why the research matters in terms a thoughtful
non-anthropologist can appreciate.

### The cultural exchange imperative

Every section should demonstrate that the applicant will be a good cultural
ambassador. Specific strategies for Fulbright anthropology applicants:

- Show how ethnographic methods inherently involve deep community engagement
  (participant observation, language learning, building relationships)
- Describe specific plans for community interaction beyond the research
  itself (teaching, workshops, volunteering, cultural exchange activities)
- Frame the project as producing mutual understanding, not just extracting
  data
- Show awareness of the host country's educational system and research
  landscape

### Compression

At 6,000 characters, every word must earn its place. For an anthropology
project this means:

- Lead with the research question and why it matters (first 500 characters)
- Briefly establish theoretical significance without jargon
- Describe methods concisely — focus on what you will actually do, not
  methodological philosophy
- Dedicate meaningful space to timeline, community engagement, and the
  why-this-country connection
- Do not attempt a literature review — instead, name 2–3 key scholarly
  conversations you are contributing to

### Host country connection

Fulbright strongly favors projects where there is a clear, necessary
connection between the research and the specific host country. "I study
global migration patterns" is weaker than "Understanding how Oaxacan
transnational networks operate requires sustained ethnographic engagement
in Oaxaca."

## Common Pitfalls for Anthropology Applicants

| Pitfall | Why it fails | Prevention |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Jargon-heavy prose | Reviewers include non-specialists | Translate all disciplinary terms into accessible language |
| Research-only framing | Ignores cultural exchange dimension | Dedicate 15–20% of Grant Purpose to community engagement |
| No host affiliation secured | Feasibility concern | Contact potential hosts early; include affiliation letter |
| Generic engagement plans | "I will learn about the culture" is not specific | Name concrete activities: language exchange, workshops, public talks |
| Overambitious scope for timeline | Fulbright grants are 6–12 months typically | Match research design to the actual grant duration |
| Personal Statement repeats Grant Purpose | Wastes the only space for personal narrative | Grant Purpose = what; Personal Statement = why you, personal motivations |
| Ignoring country-specific requirements | Each country has different award structures | Always start by reading the country program summary |
| No timeline in Grant Purpose | Required and evaluated | Include a month-by-month or phase-based timeline |

## Interaction with Dissertation Prospectus

If the user is adapting a dissertation prospectus for Fulbright:

1. **Radical compression.** A 25-page prospectus must become ~2 pages
   (6,000 characters). This requires ruthless prioritization: research
   question, why this matters, methods, timeline, engagement plan.
2. **Register translation.** Remove all disciplinary jargon. Write for an
   educated general audience.
3. **Add cultural exchange framing.** The prospectus almost certainly lacks
   this. Articulate how the research itself is an act of mutual understanding
   and how you will engage beyond the research.
4. **Write a Personal Statement.** This is a separate document that does not
   exist in the prospectus. It is autobiographical — why you are drawn to
   this work, your relationship to the community, what shaped you.
5. **Secure a host affiliation.** Prospectuses typically name a committee,
   not a host institution abroad. Fulbright requires a specific in-country
   host.
6. **Frame for the country.** Show why this specific country (not just this
   topic) is essential.
7. **Budget is not your concern.** Fulbright awards are standardized by
   country (stipend + airfare + benefits). No budget proposal is required.
