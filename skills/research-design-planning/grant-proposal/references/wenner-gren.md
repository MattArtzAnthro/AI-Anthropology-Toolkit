## Program Overview

The Wenner-Gren Foundation awards Dissertation Fieldwork Grants to fund
doctoral or thesis research that advances anthropological knowledge. The
Foundation defines anthropology broadly as a discipline that advances
knowledge about what it means to be human. There is no preference for any
methodology, research location, topic, or subfield. The Foundation
particularly welcomes proposals that integrate two or more subfields and
pioneer new approaches and ideas.

**Maximum award:** $25,000 (nonrenewable)
**Duration:** No limit; may cover distinct research phases (e.g., two summers)
**Deadlines:** May 1 (start dates Jan 1–Jun 30 following year) and November 1
(start dates Jul 1–Dec 31 following year). Portal opens 2 months before
deadline. Review takes ~6 months.
**Overhead:** Not covered. No institutional fees.
**Reviews:** Double anonymous. Reviewers do not see applicant identity.

- Any nationality or institutional affiliation
- Must designate a dissertation advisor from the same institution as supervisor
- Must complete all doctoral requirements except the dissertation before the
  project start date (proof required from department if funded)
- Resubmissions welcome but must include a resubmission statement addressing
  reviewer concerns
- The Foundation has a Generative AI policy — applicants must disclose use

## Application Structure

The application consists of these components, each with strict formatting:

### 1. Applicant Profile (not seen by reviewers)

Contact information, educational history, current position, supervisor
information. Supervisor must be at the same department/institution.
Optional demographic information for equity tracking.

### 2. Project Information

- **Project title:** ≤25 words. Descriptive enough to convey what the project
  is about. (Title is publicly reported if funded.)
- **Amount requested** in US dollars
- **Three keywords or phrases** describing the research
- **Subdiscipline and regional/topical area**
- **Project duration and location,** including start date
- **Academic collaborators** (individuals responsible for substantial portions)
- **Other academic personnel** (individuals with limited but crucial roles,
  including local research assistants)
- **Other funding applications** (list all other agencies approached — this
  does not jeopardize chances; if other funding covers expenses not in the
  Wenner-Gren budget, indicate in Q3a/3b whether the project is still
  feasible without that support)
- **Research permits and ethical approvals** (list required permits with
  estimated dates; do not submit copies at application stage)

### 3. Abstract (200 words)

Write in language an interested layperson could understand. Begin broad
(major theme or debate in anthropology), then go narrow (particular question).
Convey the "why," "what," and "where" while giving a sense of the "how"
(methods for gathering evidence). This is the shortest but hardest part —
write it last.

### 4. Project Description Questions (6 questions, strict word limits)

**Use all available space.** Underlength answers are a missed opportunity.

#### Question 1: Research Purpose and Focus (1,000 words)

What is the main research question? What other questions must be answered
to address it? Provide background on the research setting and explain why
it is the right context for these questions.

Three major guidelines from Wenner-Gren:
1. Carefully formulate the research question, hypothesis, or objective. Ask
   "why," "how," or "what" about an issue of significance to anthropology.
   Develop answerable questions (or testable hypotheses) within a larger
   research topic — do not present a vast question as the object of
   investigation.
2. Do not present research questions as if the answers were already known.
   Demonstrate that the research will actually answer or test the questions.
3. Be realistic about what can be achieved. Many applications fail because
   they claim to answer a wide variety of questions without convincing
   reviewers that any single one will be answered thoroughly.

Find a focus that allows addressing questions through a range of different
avenues (given uncertain conditions).

#### Question 2: Engagement with Existing Scholarship (1,000 words)

How does the research draw inspiration from existing scholarship in
anthropology and other disciplines? Tell the story of how you arrived at
the research question. Who else has written about this? What has been
missing? What new insights come from other lines of scholarship? What
conceptual resources will you bring to bear?

Key requirements:
- Demonstrate good knowledge of anthropological literature relevant to the
  topic AND relevant literature from other disciplines
- Be explicit about how the research expands on previous work
- If conducting research in a country with a rich tradition of anthropological
  scholarship on your topic, cite the relevant publications (see Motion of
  the 32nd RBA on global anthropologies)
- Wenner-Gren prioritizes theoretically driven research — it is not enough
  to just cite literature. Provide clear, comprehensive discussion of issues
  at stake and demonstrate how the work fits current debates
- For primatologists: clearly demonstrate how research derives from and
  contributes to anthropological debates about humanity's cultural/biological
  origins, development, and/or modern variation

#### Question 3a: Research Methodology — Plan A (1,000 words)

What evidence will you collect to answer your research question? How will
you collect and analyze it? This is the best-case scenario: research
activities if able to travel and meet participants safely and ethically
in person.

Requirements:
- Clearly demonstrate that evidence gathered and analysis proposed will
  realistically support the research goals from Q1
- Provide a feasible research plan with clearly defined procedures
- Provide a timeline for the research
- Demonstrate ability to complete planned activities in allotted time and
  with available funds
- If research is in phases, explain why separate trips are needed
- If requesting top-up funds for existing funding, provide strong
  justification (not just "collect more data")

The Foundation supports all appropriate methods: qualitative and quantitative;
laboratory, archival, and/or museum research; fieldwork involving
archaeological, survey, or ethnographic techniques.

#### Question 3b: Research Methodology — Plan B (1,000 words)

How will you address research questions if unable to travel or meet in
person? What methods will ensure the research remains safe and ethical?

This is not optional. Include: alternative sampling pathways, remote methods,
archival pivots, digital ethnography options. Explain what claims would no
longer be supportable under Plan B. Address safety and ethics of alternative
methods.

#### Question 4: Why You Are the Right Person (1,000 words)

How you became committed to this work. Background and relationship to the
community/communities affected. Preparation: language competence, technical
skills, previous research, other relevant experience. Work already done on
this project. How this research relates to other research you have done.

If working with collaborators, describe their roles and contributions.

The Foundation assesses preparation carefully:
- Required language skills and technical expertise
- Advice from local scholars, academic affiliations arranged
- Pilot project results (if any)
- Network of local contacts
- Plans for safety or access issues

Do not name your program or institution (to avoid prestige bias in double-
anonymous review). Personal information is welcome if relevant.

#### Question 5: Ethical Issues (500 words)

Discuss the most salient ethical issues and how you are approaching them.
The Foundation's understanding of ethics extends far beyond IRB:

- Think broadly about obligations to research participants, descendant
  communities, local stakeholders, and others affected by the work
- All research creates debts — what do you owe the people who make your
  research possible?
- For human remains: how are you constructing identity of the people whose
  remains you study? What engagement with descendant communities?
- For collections: how were they formed? Whose voices are included? What
  power dynamics are in play?
- What risks does the research pose and to whom? Who will benefit?

The Foundation frames ethics around three foundational principles: respect
for persons (autonomy + protection of vulnerable individuals), beneficence
(maximize benefit-to-harm ratio), and justice (fair distribution of burden
and benefits of research).

A well-articulated response seriously addresses how broad principles guide
the project's particular ethical concerns and commitments.

#### Question 6: Contribution to Anthropology (500 words)

What contribution will the project make to one or more traditions of
anthropology? The Foundation funds scholars who will do more than add to
existing knowledge. Describe how the project brings new insights to the
field and helps the discipline live up to its full potential.

Be explicit about what the research adds to wider anthropological
conversations and how funding this project builds capacity in the
discipline as a whole.

### 5. Bibliography (≤10 pages)

- Only list sources cited in the resubmission statement or project
  description questions
- In-text citations: (Author Year) or (Author Year: page). Examples:
  (Baviskar 1995), (Friedner and Osborne 2015), (Nelson et al. 2017),
  (Zee 2020: 1068)
- Single-line spacing, 10-point font or larger
- Complete references, alphabetical order
- Use a format compatible with major English-language anthropological
  journals (Current Anthropology, Ethnos, AJPA, etc.) — be consistent

### 6. Budget (Plan A and Plan B)

Both budgets must request the same total amount (≤$25,000). Develop budgets
based on Q3a and Q3b. Include only items requested from Wenner-Gren. Items
not fully justified will not be considered.

#### Covered expenses:

- **Research expenses:** Travel, living expenses during fieldwork, childcare,
  research assistance, transcription costs, specialized software, gifts for
  informants, visa fees, other relevant research expenditures
- **Per diems:** Must reflect actual costs; rarely pays US State Dept rates;
  consult Fulbright-Hays or ESRC for estimates; justify all amounts
- **Course relief:** If unable to travel and conducting research remotely
- **Tuition fees:** If unable to travel and conducting research remotely
- **Compensation for research participants and community members:** Fair and
  appropriate compensation; justify reciprocation measures
- **Supplies and equipment:** Cost-effective and appropriate; items ≥$2,500
  require a donation statement (why needed, why not available through
  institution, what happens to it after project)
- **Medical insurance:** Maximum $125/month, only while at research site
- **Equipment insurance:** Justify coverage level and role of covered items

Special requirements for research/transcription assistance requests:
- Explain why help is needed
- Specify which aspects you do vs. the assistant does
- Justify payment level relative to local wage rates
- Specify number of assistants and time commitment
- The Foundation expects grantees to participate in all aspects of research

#### NOT covered:

- Salary and/or fringe benefits
- Personal income taxes
- Travel/expenses of family members and non-project personnel
- Travel to meetings not part of research
- Return trips to consult with supervisor
- Institutional overhead
- Expenses before grant effective date
- Writing or publication expenses
- Expenses at non-research locations (rent, mortgage, storage, etc.)
- Living expenses while writing thesis
- Contingency funds or miscellaneous expenses

Multiple trips to the field require justification. The Foundation does not
fund: pilot research, trips home for consultation/preliminary analysis,
or supervisor field visits.

### 7. Resubmission Statement (1,000 words, if applicable)

If resubmitting a previously unsuccessful application, describe: progress
since last application, how thinking has developed, how plans have been
refined, how the application differs from previous, how reviewer concerns
have been addressed.

### 8. Optional Figures

Charts, maps, or graphs referred to in the project description. Use
sparingly — only include figures essential for communicating plans and goals.

## Evaluation Criteria

Reviewers assess quality of proposed research, potential contribution to
anthropological knowledge, and adherence to the Foundation's mission
(including fostering an inclusive vision of anthropology). Applicants are
expected to draw from a broad range of scholarship, including relevant
work in English and other languages.

Successful proposals have:
1. A well-defined research question
2. A detailed description of the evidence that will be sought
3. A feasible plan for gathering and analyzing this evidence
4. A discussion of the applicant's qualifications
5. A compelling account of the project's potential to advance anthropological
   knowledge and transform debates in the field

Primatology/primate conservation proposals must demonstrate broader
anthropological relevance. Language structure/endangered language proposals
must be grounded in anthropological concerns.

## Common Pitfalls (from Wenner-Gren guidance)

| Pitfall | Guidance |
|---------|----------|
| Vast, unanswerable main question | Develop answerable questions within the larger topic |
| Answers presented as already known | Show genuine uncertainty; demonstrate research will test/answer |
| Claiming to answer too many questions | Focus on answering a small number thoroughly |
| Literature cited without discussion | Provide clear discussion of issues at stake, not just citations |
| Ignoring local/non-English scholarship | Cite relevant publications from the research country |
| Ethics limited to IRB framing | Think broadly about debts, community obligations, power, risk |
| Budget items not justified | Every item needs detailed justification; unjustified items won't be funded |
| Underlength responses | Use all available space — word limits are there to be used |

## Interaction with Dissertation Prospectus

If the user is adapting a dissertation prospectus for Wenner-Gren, key
adaptations needed:

1. **Restructure into the 6-question format.** The prospectus narrative must
   be decomposed into Wenner-Gren's specific questions. This is not just
   reformatting — each question has a distinct rhetorical purpose.
2. **Double-anonymous preparation.** Remove all identifying information
   (program name, institution, advisor name) from the project description.
3. **Sharpen the contribution argument** (Q6). Wenner-Gren wants explicit
   claims about field-level impact, not just "my project fills a gap."
4. **Develop a genuine Plan B** (Q3b). This cannot be an afterthought.
5. **Write ethics substantively** (Q5). Wenner-Gren's ethics expectations
   go well beyond IRB compliance.
6. **Budget dual versions.** Plan A and Plan B budgets must total the same
   amount but allocate differently.
7. **Compress the bibliography.** 10-page cap means ruthless selectivity —
   only cite sources actually referenced in the text.
