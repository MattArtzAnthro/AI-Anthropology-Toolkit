  Use this skill whenever a user needs help writing, drafting, revising, or
  structuring a grant proposal, funding application, or dissertation prospectus
  for anthropological research. Triggers include: any mention of NSF, Wenner-Gren,
  Fulbright, ERC, SSHRC, Wellcome, or other research funders in the context of
  anthropology or ethnographic research; requests to write a Project Description,
  research narrative, budget justification, broader impacts statement, or
  specific aims page; requests to draft or revise a dissertation prospectus or
  fieldwork grant; questions about how to frame ethnographic methods for a
  grant committee; requests to translate a research plan into a funder-specific
  format. Also use when the user mentions "grant writing," "proposal writing,"
  "funding application," or "fellowship application" in the context of
  anthropology, sociology, STS, or other social science fieldwork research.
  Do NOT use for general academic writing (use academic-paper skill), research
  plan writing without a specific funder (use research-plan skill), or IRB/ethics
  protocols (use ethics-consent skill).

# Anthropology Grant Proposal Writing

Write grant proposals and funding applications for anthropological research that
are funder-compliant, methodologically rigorous, and rhetorically persuasive to
multidisciplinary review panels. Proposals should read as evidentiary contracts —
specifying what data will be produced, how it will be analyzed, and how claims
will travel beyond a single site — while preserving the interpretive depth and
epistemic commitments that distinguish anthropological research.

## Quick Reference

| Funder / Genre | Reference File |
|----------------|----------------|
| NSF Cultural Anthropology (BCS, CA-DDRIG) | Read [references/nsf-cultural-anthro.md](references/nsf-cultural-anthro.md) |
| Wenner-Gren (Dissertation Fieldwork, Post-PhD, Hunt) | Read [references/wenner-gren.md](references/wenner-gren.md) |
| Fulbright (IIE, Fulbright-Hays DDRA) | Read [references/fulbright.md](references/fulbright.md) |
| Dissertation prospectus (committee, not funder) | Use the general workflow below; no funder-specific reference needed |
| Applied / consulting proposal | Use the general workflow below; adapt formality register to client |

For funders not listed above (ERC, SSHRC, Wellcome, etc.), use the general
workflow and cross-cutting principles below. The architectural patterns —
evidentiary contract structure, methods as feasibility signal, ethics as
design — transfer across funders even when specific formatting rules differ.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Funder and Genre

Determine which funding mechanism the user is targeting. This shapes everything
downstream: page/word limits, required sections, evaluation criteria, budget
rules, and rhetorical conventions.

Ask the user if not immediately clear:
- **Which funder and program?** (e.g., "NSF CA-DDRIG," "Wenner-Gren DFG," "Fulbright IIE")
- **What career stage?** Dissertation, postdoctoral, early career, senior. This
  affects eligibility, budget scale, and how "capability" is demonstrated.
- **Is this a new submission or a revision/resubmission?** Resubmissions have
  distinct rhetorical requirements (responding to prior reviewer feedback).

If a specific funder is identified and a reference file exists, load it now.
The reference file contains funder-specific section requirements, page limits,
evaluation criteria, budget rules, and common pitfalls. Follow those constraints
as hard requirements — they override the general guidance below.

If no funder is specified, proceed with the general workflow. The user may be
at the "exploring options" stage, in which case help them identify suitable
funders based on their project, career stage, and timeline.

### Step 2: Gather Project Context

Collect the information needed to write a compelling proposal. Not all of this
is needed upfront — gather what you can and note gaps for the user to fill.

**Essential context (proposal cannot proceed without these):**
- Research question(s) — the specific empirical puzzle the project addresses
- Field site(s) and population/community
- Core methods (what data will be produced and how)
- Epistemic stance (see Parameters below) — this shapes methods language,
  theoretical framing, and what counts as "contribution"
- Timeline and duration of proposed research

**Important context (strengthens the proposal significantly):**
- Theoretical framework and key interlocutors in the literature
- Preliminary data, pilot work, or prior fieldwork experience at the site
- Access pathway — how the researcher will gain and maintain field access
- Ethical considerations — consent approach, risk posture, community relationships
- Intended outputs — publications, community deliverables, data deposits

**Helpful context (improves tailoring):**
- The user's disciplinary subfield and home department
- Advisor(s) and committee composition
- Prior submission history with this funder (resubmission context)
- Whether the user has drafts of any sections already

### Step 3: Set Parameters

Configure the proposal based on user context. These parameters shape the
language, structure, and emphasis of the output.

**Epistemic stance** — Determines how methods are described, what theoretical
vocabulary is appropriate, and how "contribution" is framed. A critical medical
anthropologist writing for NSF needs different methods language than an STS
scholar or a linguistic anthropologist, even if the proposal structure is
identical. Ask the user to identify their primary stance; most researchers
work at intersections, so a primary + secondary is common.

**Funder register** — Each funder has implicit expectations about writing style.
NSF panels expect clear, sometimes quasi-positivist framing even for
interpretive projects ("testable expectations" rather than "hypotheses" can
thread this needle). Wenner-Gren values concise, integrated narratives that
foreground the research question's anthropological significance. Fulbright
panels include non-specialists and country experts, requiring accessible
language and strong country-specific justification. Match the register to
the funder.

**Risk posture** — Projects involving vulnerable populations, politically
sensitive contexts, or high-surveillance environments need enhanced ethics
framing, explicit safety protocols, and often a Plan B for disrupted access.
Wenner-Gren requires Plan B explicitly; other funders reward it implicitly.

**Field configuration** — Single-site, multi-sited, digital, archival, hybrid,
or comparative. This affects how methods are described, how the timeline is
structured, and what feasibility concerns reviewers will anticipate.

**Compression level** — Determined by the funder's page/word limits. A 2-page
doctoral fellowship narrative requires radical compression; a 15-page NSF
Project Description allows methodological depth. Internal word budgets should
be allocated proportionally (see Step 4).

### Step 4: Structure the Proposal

Use the funder-specific reference file for exact section requirements. When
no funder-specific reference is available, use the following general
architecture. This structure reflects how winning proposals across major
anthropology funders organize their narratives — a "why-what-how" macro-structure
that minimizes reviewer cognitive load.

**General proposal architecture (adapt to funder constraints):**

1. **Aims and research question** (~10-15% of narrative)
   - State the central research question in one sentence
   - Present 2-3 linked aims, each with a defined evidentiary output
   - Frame aims as an evidence-production sequence: each aim produces a
     concrete product that constrains the next
   - End with a sentence that tells the reviewer what this project delivers

2. **Significance and state of the art** (~20-30% of narrative)
   - Identify the specific analytic tension or gap in the literature
   - Position the project relative to named interlocutors (not a literature
     review — a strategic argument about what's missing)
   - Articulate why this matters now and for whom
   - For NSF: this maps to Intellectual Merit; connect to generalizable
     scientific contribution, not just ethnographic description

3. **Conceptual framework** (~10-15% of narrative, often integrated with #2)
   - Name the theoretical tools the project deploys
   - End with analytic expectations — what the theoretical framework
     predicts or makes legible about the empirical situation
   - These expectations should be specific enough that the methods section
     can be organized around producing evidence to adjudicate them

4. **Research design and methods** (~30-40% of narrative)
   - Describe data production as a chain of invariants that survive field
     contingencies: sampling/access → data types → collection procedures →
     analysis workflow → interpretive discipline
   - Specify what counts as a datum (fieldnotes, interviews, recordings,
     archival materials, surveys, material culture)
   - Describe sampling logic and recruitment pathway
   - Include the analysis plan: how raw data become claims (coding, 
     triangulation, comparison, model fitting)
   - Address positionality as part of analytic rigor, not as confession
   - Address feasibility: access, permissions, language competence, safety,
     timeline, and contingencies

5. **Ethics, community engagement, and data governance** (~10-15% of narrative,
   unless externalized into separate form sections)
   - Consent approach appropriate to the field context
   - Pathway to ethics approval (home IRB + host country)
   - Community engagement model coherent with the project's epistemology
   - Data management: storage, anonymization, sharing, and governance
   - For Indigenous or community-based contexts: address CARE principles
     and shared governance

6. **Broader impacts / dissemination / knowledge mobilization** (~10-15%)
   - Funder-specific: NSF requires a labeled "Broader Impacts" section;
     SSHRC requires a knowledge mobilization plan; Wellcome embeds
     engagement in application prompts
   - Specify concrete outputs: publications, community reports, policy
     briefs, workshops, data deposits
   - Connect dissemination to the project's epistemological commitments —
     who benefits and how

7. **Timeline, milestones, and risk management** (~5-10%)
   - Three levels: administrative milestones (approvals, visas, agreements),
     fieldwork milestones (site entry, recruitment, data collection modules),
     synthesis milestones (codebook stabilization, writing, dissemination)
   - Include contingency planning (Plan B) — what proceeds if access is
     disrupted, what evidence streams can substitute
   - A Gantt chart or table is often more effective than prose here

**Internal word budgets by proposal scale:**

| Scale | Total length | Typical funders |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Short (fellowship/small grant) | 900-1,200 words / 2 pages | SSHRC doctoral, some internal fellowships |
| Medium (standard research) | 3,000-5,000 words / 6-15 pages | NSF standard, SSHRC Insight, Wenner-Gren |
| Large (multi-year) | 5,000-10,000 words / 14-20 pages | ERC Starting/Consolidator, Wellcome Discovery |

### Step 5: Draft the Proposal

Generate proposal text that follows these principles:

**Write for the review panel, not the discipline.** Many funders explicitly
instruct applicants to write for broad audiences. Even specialist panels
include members from adjacent subfields. Avoid unexplained jargon. Define
theoretical terms on first use. Make the research question legible to a
political scientist or sociologist, not just another ethnographer of your
specific region or topic.

**Methods are a credibility device.** Reviewers use the methods section as a
proxy for competence and feasibility. Specificity builds trust: name the
number of interviews (approximate ranges are fine: "n≈30-40"), describe
sampling logic, specify analytic steps. Vague methods ("I will conduct
participant observation and interviews") are the single most common
reviewer red flag in anthropology proposals.

**Frame theory as generating analytic expectations.** The theoretical framework
should end with predictions or discriminating questions that the methods
section is organized to answer. This is what funders mean by "empirically
driven" research — not that you must test hypotheses, but that your theory
does work by directing attention and specifying what evidence would look like.

**Treat ethics as design, not compliance.** Do not relegate ethics to a
paragraph at the end. Integrate ethical considerations into the methods
description — consent procedures, data protection, community relationships,
and reciprocity should appear where they're relevant in the workflow, not
as an appendix.

**Budget should shadow the work plan.** Each cost line should answer: which
activity requires this, why this rate, and what happens if it's reduced.
Separate participant compensation from personnel costs. Justify local
collaboration labor (research assistants, translators, transcribers) with
roles, estimated time, and deliverables.

**Epistemic stance shapes everything.** An interpretivist proposal emphasizes
meaning-making, lived experience, and thick description. A critical proposal
foregrounds power relations, structural constraints, and ideological
formations. A decolonial proposal centers community governance, reciprocity,
and Indigenous knowledge systems. The same methods (e.g., semi-structured
interviews) are described differently depending on stance — what you're
looking for in the data, how you'll know you've found it, and what kind of
claims you'll make.

### Step 6: Quality Check

Before presenting the draft, verify:

- [ ] **Funder compliance:** Does the output respect page/word limits, required
  sections, and formatting rules? Does it include all mandatory components?
- [ ] **Internal coherence:** Do the aims align with the methods? Does the
  theoretical framework generate expectations that the research design can
  adjudicate? Does the timeline match the proposed activities?
- [ ] **Evidentiary specificity:** Can a reviewer trace from research question →
  data types → analytic steps → expected contribution? Are methods specific
  enough to evaluate feasibility?
- [ ] **Audience appropriateness:** Would a reviewer from an adjacent discipline
  understand the research question and why it matters? Is jargon explained?
- [ ] **Ethics integration:** Are consent, data governance, and community
  engagement woven into the design, not bolted on?
- [ ] **Budget-narrative alignment:** If a budget is included, does every major
  cost line connect to a described activity?
- [ ] **Red flag scan:** Check for the seven common reviewer red flags:
  over-breadth, theory without evidentiary stakes, methods vagueness,
  ethics as box-check, funder mission misfit, budget incoherence, and
  unreadable writing.

## Parameters

- **Epistemic stance:** All 42 stances are relevant — the stance shapes methods
  language, theoretical framing, and contribution claims. Most proposals
  draw on a primary stance with one or two secondary influences. See DESIGN.md
  for the full stance list. Common in grant writing: interpretive,
  phenomenological, critical, political economy, feminist, decolonial,
  STS, applied, mixed-methods, and computational/digital.
- **Genre/audience:** Grant proposal (NSF, Wenner-Gren, Fulbright, ERC, SSHRC,
  Wellcome, other), dissertation prospectus, applied/consulting proposal.
- **Compression:** Determined by funder page/word limits (2-page fellowship
  through 20-page ERC B2).
- **Risk posture:** Standard, enhanced (vulnerable populations), high
  (politically sensitive, high-surveillance, conflict zones).
- **Formality register:** Funder-specific. NSF/ERC lean formal-scientific;
  Wenner-Gren values concise disciplinary prose; Fulbright expects accessible
  narrative; applied proposals match client register.
- **Field configuration:** Single-site, multi-sited, digital, archival,
  hybrid, comparative. Affects methods description and feasibility framing.

## Guardrails

**Hard stops — refuse to proceed without these:**
- Do not generate a full proposal draft without knowing the target funder
  (or confirming it's a general/exploratory draft). Funder constraints are
  not optional formatting — they determine what reviewers evaluate.
- Do not generate budget figures without a basis. If the user hasn't
  provided cost estimates, generate a budget template with line items and
  notes on what to research, not fabricated numbers.
- Do not fabricate citations or preliminary data. If the user mentions
  pilot work or literature, incorporate it. If not, flag where citations
  and evidence should go with clear placeholders.
- Do not produce consent language or ethics text that contradicts the
  stated risk posture. High-risk projects require explicit safety protocols
  and cannot use boilerplate consent paragraphs.

**Soft warnings — flag but proceed:**
- If the research question is very broad (trying to answer too many things),
  note this as the most common reason proposals fail at Wenner-Gren and NSF,
  and suggest narrowing to 2-3 linked aims.
- If methods are described only in general terms ("ethnographic methods,"
  "qualitative research"), flag that reviewers will read this as a
  feasibility gap and push for specificity.
- If the theoretical framework doesn't generate analytic expectations that
  the methods can adjudicate, note the disconnect — theory and methods should
  be interlocking, not separate sections.
- If the user's timeline seems unrealistic for the proposed scope, flag it.
  Reviewers treat timeline credibility as a feasibility indicator.

## Common Failure Modes

**Generic social science prose.** The most common failure. The proposal reads
like it could be from any discipline — no ethnographic specificity, no
attention to positionality, no thick description of the field context.
Anthropology proposals should make the reader feel the site, the stakes,
and the researcher's relationship to the community, even within tight
page limits.

**Methods section as wish list.** "I will conduct participant observation,
semi-structured interviews, and archival research" — with no sampling logic,
no analysis plan, and no account of how these methods produce evidence that
bears on the research question. This is the single most common reviewer
complaint. Specify what you'll observe and why, who you'll interview and
how you'll select them, what you'll look for in the archives and how you'll
analyze it.

**Theory-method disconnect.** The literature review discusses three theoretical
frameworks, and the methods section describes generic qualitative procedures.
The frameworks should generate specific analytic questions that the methods
are designed to answer. If the theory doesn't do work in the methods section,
it's decorative.

**Ethics as afterthought.** A single paragraph at the end saying "I will obtain
IRB approval and informed consent." This fails because ethics review is
increasingly a feasibility and design question — reviewers want to see that
the researcher has thought through consent modalities appropriate to the
field context, data protection, community engagement, and reciprocity.

**Overclaiming significance.** "This project will transform our understanding
of X." Reviewers are skeptical of grandiose claims. Be specific about what
the project contributes: what analytic uncertainty it resolves, what evidence
it produces, who can use the findings and how.

**Ignoring the funder's evaluation criteria.** Each funder tells you exactly
what reviewers are asked to evaluate. NSF's two merit criteria (Intellectual
Merit and Broader Impacts), Wenner-Gren's emphasis on well-developed questions
and feasible plans, ERC's focus on "beyond the state of the art" — these
are not suggestions. Structure the proposal so reviewers can easily find
answers to their evaluation questions.

## Examples

**Example 1: NSF CA-DDRIG proposal**
Input: "I'm writing an NSF cultural anthropology DDRIG about how climate
refugees in coastal Bangladesh negotiate relocation decisions. I'm an
interpretivist doing 12 months of fieldwork in two villages."
Output approach: Load [references/nsf-cultural-anthro.md](references/nsf-cultural-anthro.md).
Set parameters: epistemic stance = interpretive (primary), political ecology
(secondary); field configuration = comparative (two sites); risk posture =
enhanced (displaced populations); compression = 10 pages single-spaced
(DDRIG limit). Structure around NSF's required components: problem,
intellectual merit, broader impacts, training, positionality, research
design. Frame "relocation decision-making" as a generalizable process
(not just a description of one community's experience) to meet NSF's
scientific contribution requirement. Methods section specifies participant
observation protocols, interview sampling (household heads, community
leaders, government officials, NGO workers — ~40-50 interviews), and
comparative analytic strategy across the two villages.

**Example 2: Wenner-Gren Dissertation Fieldwork Grant**
Input: "I need to write a Wenner-Gren DFG application. My project is on
the everyday ethics of AI-assisted medical diagnosis in urban India.
I'm working from a critical medical anthropology perspective."
Output approach: Load [references/wenner-gren.md](references/wenner-gren.md).
Set parameters: epistemic stance = critical medical (primary), STS
(secondary); field configuration = single-site; risk posture = standard
(clinical settings require care but are not high-risk); compression =
strict per-question word limits (Q1=1000w, Q2=1000w, etc.). Structure
each question response as a self-contained mini-argument ending with a
sentence that tells the reviewer what to conclude. Include Plan B for
disrupted clinical access (pivot to telemedicine consultations, remote
interviews with practitioners). Budget under $25,000, no overhead,
following Wenner-Gren's explicit exclusions.

**Example 3: Fulbright IIE research grant**
Input: "I'm applying for a Fulbright to Japan to study how aging
communities use social robots. Where do I start?"
Output approach: Load [references/fulbright.md](references/fulbright.md).
Set parameters: epistemic stance = STS/actor-network (primary),
phenomenological (secondary); field configuration = multi-sited
(likely multiple care facilities); risk posture = enhanced (elderly
populations); compression = per Fulbright format requirements. Fulbright
panels include country experts and non-anthropologists — write the
research narrative in accessible language. Emphasize cultural exchange
dimensions and host institution relationship (Fulbright's distinctive
priority). Address Japanese research ethics requirements and
institutional affiliation logistics.

**Example 4: Dissertation prospectus (no external funder)**
Input: "My committee wants a 20-page prospectus. I'm studying gig
economy labor organizing in Mexico City from a political economy
perspective."
Output approach: No funder-specific reference needed. Set parameters:
epistemic stance = political economy/Marxian (primary), practice theory
(secondary); field configuration = multi-sited (multiple platforms,
worker collectives, regulatory spaces); risk posture = enhanced
(labor organizing in politically sensitive context). A prospectus is a
proposal to the committee: demonstrate command of the literature,
justify the methods, and show the project is feasible within the
degree timeline. More space for theoretical depth than a typical grant,
but the evidentiary contract structure still applies — the committee
needs to see that the research design can produce the evidence needed
to make the theoretical contribution promised in the framing.
