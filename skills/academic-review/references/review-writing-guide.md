## Review Anatomy: The Six-Part Structure

Every peer review follows a consistent architecture. The six sections below
move from demonstrating engagement to providing evaluation to delivering a
recommendation. Each section has a distinct purpose; collapsing them together
weakens the review.

### 1. Summary Paragraph

**Purpose:** Show the author (and editor) that you read the manuscript carefully.

- 3-5 sentences, written in your own words.
- Restate the central argument, the primary evidence or methods, and the
  claimed contribution.
- Do NOT copy the abstract. The summary should reflect your interpretive
  reading, not a paraphrase of the author's own description.
- A strong summary names what the paper is doing analytically, not just
  topically. "This article examines X" is weaker than "This article argues
  that X, drawing on Y to show Z."
- If you cannot summarize the argument in 3-5 sentences, that itself is
  diagnostic: the argument may not be clearly stated in the manuscript.

**What to include:**
- The central claim or thesis
- The type and scope of evidence (fieldwork duration, sites, methods)
- The theoretical conversation the paper enters
- The claimed contribution to the field

**What to avoid:**
- Evaluative language (save that for later sections)
- Abstract-style listing of topics covered
- Summarizing every section of the paper

### 2. Contribution Assessment

**Purpose:** Situate the manuscript within the scholarly conversation it aims
to advance.

- Identify which specific debate, literature, or gap the paper addresses.
- Assess whether the contribution is genuinely new: new evidence, new framing,
  new theoretical synthesis, new methodological approach, or new empirical
  domain for an existing argument.
- Name the audience who would benefit from this work.
- Be honest about the scale of contribution. Not every paper redefines a field.
  A well-executed empirical contribution to a specific literature is valuable
  and should be recognized as such.

**Contribution types common in anthropology:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Empirical | New ethnographic evidence on an under-documented topic | First long-term fieldwork with a particular community |
| Theoretical | New conceptual framework or significant revision of existing theory | Reframing care as infrastructure rather than affect |
| Methodological | New approach to ethnographic practice or analysis | Multi-modal sensory ethnography protocol |
| Synthetic | Bringing together previously disconnected literatures | Connecting STS and kinship studies through surrogacy |
| Critical | Challenging established assumptions in the field | Questioning the universality of a widely used concept |
| Comparative | Cross-case analysis yielding broader insights | Comparing water governance across three continents |

### 3. Strengths Identification

**Purpose:** Acknowledge what the manuscript does well before turning to critique.

- Be specific. "Well-written" and "interesting" are not useful praise. Name
  the passage, the argument, the methodological choice, or the analytical
  move that works.
- Genuine engagement with strengths is not a courtesy preamble. It tells the
  author (and editor) what to preserve during revision.
- Strengths may include: originality of research design, quality of
  ethnographic description, theoretical precision, effective structure,
  compelling narrative voice, rigorous engagement with relevant literature,
  ethical reflexivity.
- For manuscripts with fundamental problems, strengths identification is still
  required. Even a paper recommended for rejection has elements worth naming.

**Examples of specific vs. vague praise:**

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "The ethnography is rich" | "The extended description of the water dispute in section 3 effectively shows how bureaucratic categories become lived experience" |
| "The argument is interesting" | "The distinction between tactical and strategic belonging in section 4 offers a productive alternative to the inclusion/exclusion binary" |
| "Good use of theory" | "The deployment of Tsing's friction concept to analyze supply chain disruptions works because it connects macro-economic processes to the specific material encounters described in the warehouse ethnography" |

### 4. Major Issues

**Purpose:** Identify 2-4 substantive concerns that require revision for the
manuscript to succeed.

Major issues are problems that affect the paper's core argument, evidentiary
basis, or scholarly contribution. They require significant revision, not
cosmetic fixes.

**Structure each major issue with three components:**

1. **Name the problem.** State clearly what the issue is.
2. **Explain why it matters.** Connect the problem to the manuscript's goals
   or to disciplinary standards.
3. **Suggest a path forward.** Offer at least one concrete suggestion for how
   to address it.

**Separate conceptual problems from execution problems:**

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Conceptual | Problems with the argument itself | Logical gaps, unsupported claims, theoretical incoherence, missing engagement with key literature |
| Execution | Problems with how the argument is presented | Evidence not connected to claims, unclear structure, methods insufficiently described, analysis underdeveloped |

**Guidelines for major issues:**

- Limit to 2-4 issues. More than four major issues signals a paper that may
  need rejection rather than revision. If you have more, prioritize the most
  consequential.
- Each issue should be independent. If two concerns are really aspects of the
  same problem, combine them.
- Distinguish between what the paper does poorly and what you wish the paper
  did differently. Only the former is a valid major issue.
- For theoretical concerns: name the specific gap or incoherence rather than
  prescribing a theoretical framework. "The paper does not adequately theorize
  the relationship between X and Y" is better than "The paper should use
  Foucault."
- For evidentiary concerns: identify what is missing and why it matters for
  the argument, not simply that you want more data.

### 5. Minor Issues

**Purpose:** List smaller concerns that would improve the manuscript but do not
require fundamental revision.

Minor issues include:

- **Clarity:** Sentences, paragraphs, or sections that are unclear or could be
  more precisely stated.
- **Citation gaps:** Relevant work the author should engage with, framed as
  suggestions rather than requirements.
- **Structural suggestions:** Reordering sections, moving material to
  footnotes, cutting redundancy.
- **Factual corrections:** Dates, names, translations, or contextual details
  that appear incorrect.
- **Formatting and style:** Issues with the reference list, inconsistent
  transliteration, missing translations of non-English terms.

**Guidelines:**

- Present minor issues as a numbered or bulleted list.
- Be specific: cite page numbers, paragraph locations, or section numbers.
- Minor issues should not be disguised major issues. If a "minor" concern
  actually affects the core argument, promote it.
- Limit citation suggestions. Recommending 1-3 relevant works is helpful;
  listing 15 is not.
- Do not copyedit. Peer review is not line editing. Note patterns (e.g.,
  "passive voice obscures agency in several key passages") rather than
  marking individual sentences.

### 6. Overall Recommendation

**Purpose:** Provide a clear editorial recommendation with a rationale tied
to the issues identified above.

**Standard recommendation categories:**

| Recommendation | When to use | What it signals |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Accept | Rare. Paper is publication-ready or needs only trivial corrections. | No substantive changes needed. |
| Minor revisions | Paper is strong. Issues are limited in scope and clearly addressable. | Author can revise without re-review. |
| Major revisions / R&R | Paper has a viable core but significant issues need resolution. | Author should revise substantially; re-review expected. |
| Reject | Paper has fundamental problems that revision cannot address, or the contribution is insufficient for the venue. | Manuscript should not be published in this form at this journal. |
| Reject with encouragement | Paper has potential but needs extensive reworking beyond what a single revision cycle can achieve. | Author should substantially reconceive and resubmit to this or another journal. |

**Guidelines:**

- The recommendation must follow logically from the review. If you identify
  only minor issues, do not recommend major revisions. If you identify
  fundamental conceptual problems, do not recommend minor revisions.
- State the recommendation clearly and early in this section, then provide
  the rationale.
- When recommending R&R, specify which issues are essential to address and
  which are suggestions for improvement.
- When recommending rejection, remain constructive. Even a rejection review
  should help the author improve the work for another venue.
- Do not hedge. "I lean toward major revisions but could see minor revisions"
  is not helpful. Commit to a recommendation and justify it.

## AAA Reviewing Ethics

Peer review is a professional obligation and a form of disciplinary service.
The American Anthropological Association and its member journals operate on
the principle that scholars who benefit from peer review owe the system their
participation as reviewers.

### Core Ethical Principles

**Timeliness.** Respond to review invitations promptly (within 1 week).
Complete reviews within the agreed timeframe, typically 3-4 weeks. If you
cannot meet the deadline, notify the editor immediately. Late reviews delay
careers, especially for untenured scholars.

**Confidentiality.** The manuscript is confidential. Do not share it, discuss
its contents with colleagues, or use the ideas or data in your own work before
publication. Do not reveal your identity as reviewer to the author (in blind
review) or reveal the author's identity to others.

**Conflict of interest.** Decline to review if you have a personal, professional,
or financial relationship with the author that could bias your evaluation. This
includes: current or recent collaborators, advisor/advisee relationships,
close personal friends, scholars at the same institution, anyone whose work
you have publicly praised or criticized in ways that would compromise
impartiality. When in doubt, disclose the potential conflict to the editor
and let them decide.

**Expertise match.** Decline reviews that fall entirely outside your expertise.
It is acceptable to review a paper where you have partial expertise (e.g., you
know the theory but not the region) as long as you disclose this in your review.
Reviewing outside your expertise wastes the author's time and undermines the
system.

**Constructive obligation.** Your review should help the author improve the
manuscript. Destructive criticism (tearing down without offering paths forward)
is an ethical failure, not intellectual rigor. Even a recommendation for
rejection should include constructive feedback about how the work could be
strengthened for another venue.

**Fairness.** Evaluate the manuscript on its merits, not on the author's
identity, institutional affiliation, theoretical orientation, or career stage.
Blind review exists to support this, but the obligation holds regardless of
review format.

### Time Expectations

| Phase | Expected timeline |
|-------|-------------------|
| Respond to invitation | 3-7 days |
| Complete review | 3-4 weeks from acceptance |
| Notify editor if delayed | Immediately upon recognizing delay |
| Re-review of revised manuscript | 2-3 weeks |

## Evaluation Criteria by Journal Type

Different journals have different standards. Calibrate your review to the venue.

### AAA Flagships

**Journals:** American Ethnologist, American Anthropologist, Cultural
Anthropology, Journal of Linguistic Anthropology, American Journal of Physical
Anthropology (now AJBA)

**Expectations:**
- Significant theoretical contribution: the paper must advance a conceptual
  conversation, not merely report findings.
- Deep ethnographic engagement: extended fieldwork, participant voice,
  analytical depth. Short research visits or thin description are insufficient.
- Manuscript length: typically 8,000-12,000 words including references.
- Literature engagement: thorough and current, with demonstrated mastery of
  the relevant theoretical conversation.
- Writing quality: clear, precise, and analytically sharp. Narrative craft is
  valued, especially at AE and Cultural Anthropology.
- Rejection rate: 85-95%. A recommendation for R&R at these journals signals
  genuine potential.

### Regional Journals

**Examples:** Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology, Asian
Anthropology, Africa, Oceania, American Indian Culture and Research Journal

**Expectations:**
- Area expertise: demonstrated familiarity with the region's scholarship, not
  just application of metropolitan theory to non-Western contexts.
- Engagement with local scholarship: citation of scholars from the region,
  not exclusively Euro-American references.
- Empirical contribution: strong fieldwork and data are valued even when
  theoretical framing is more modest.
- Language: engagement with scholarship in languages relevant to the region.
- Manuscript length: varies, often 6,000-10,000 words.

### Interdisciplinary Outlets

**Examples:** Social Science & Medicine, Environment and Planning D, Economy
and Society, Public Culture, positions

**Expectations:**
- Accessibility: the argument must be legible to readers outside anthropology.
  Discipline-specific jargon needs explanation or avoidance.
- Theoretical bridge-building: the paper should connect anthropological
  insights to conversations in adjacent fields.
- Methods transparency: interdisciplinary audiences expect more explicit
  methodological description than anthropology-internal audiences.
- Broader relevance: the "so what" question is more demanding when the
  audience spans multiple disciplines.

### Open-Access and Specialty Journals

**Examples:** HAU, Anthropological Theory, Journal of Material Culture,
Medical Anthropology, Collaborative Anthropologies

**Expectations:**
- Methodological contribution: specialty journals often value innovation in
  approach as much as findings.
- Subfield advancement: deep engagement with the specialty area's internal
  debates.
- Variable length and format: some specialty journals accept shorter pieces,
  experimental formats, or collaborative writing.
- Open-access venues may have broader readership including non-academics;
  accessibility matters.

## Discipline-Specific Evaluation Dimensions

Use these six dimensions to structure your assessment. Not every dimension
carries equal weight for every manuscript; weight them according to the
paper's aims and the journal's expectations.

### Ethnographic Evidence

- **Depth:** Is the fieldwork sustained enough to support the claims? Extended
  participant observation carries different evidentiary weight than interviews
  alone.
- **Quality:** Are the descriptions precise, vivid, and analytically productive?
  Does the ethnography do analytical work or merely illustrate pre-formed
  arguments?
- **Ethical collection:** Are there indicators that data was gathered with
  informed consent and attention to participant welfare? Are vulnerable
  populations adequately protected?
- **Participant voice:** Do the people described in the ethnography appear as
  complex agents with their own perspectives, or are they flattened into
  examples?
- **Reflexivity:** Does the author acknowledge their position relative to the
  community and how it shapes the knowledge produced?

### Theoretical Argument

- **Coherence:** Does the theoretical framework hold together internally? Are
  concepts used consistently?
- **Literature engagement:** Does the paper engage the relevant conversation,
  or does it cite selectively to support a predetermined conclusion?
- **Originality of framing:** Does the paper offer a new way of seeing, or
  does it apply an established framework without modification?
- **Theory-ethnography integration:** Is the theory genuinely illuminated by
  the ethnography, and vice versa? Or are the theoretical and ethnographic
  sections disconnected?

### Methodological Rigor

- **Appropriateness:** Are the methods suited to the research questions?
- **Transparency:** Is the methodology described clearly enough for the reader
  to evaluate the evidential claims?
- **Reflexivity:** Does the author acknowledge methodological limitations and
  their implications?
- **Multi-method coherence:** If multiple methods are used, are they integrated
  rather than merely listed?

### Ethical Practice

- **Informed consent:** Is there evidence that participants consented to the
  research and its publication?
- **Community obligations:** Does the research account for obligations to the
  community studied, beyond IRB compliance?
- **Positionality:** Does the author reflect on power dynamics between
  researcher and researched?
- **Representation:** Are the people described in the research represented
  fairly and with dignity?

### Writing Quality

- **Clarity:** Is the argument easy to follow? Are key terms defined?
- **Structure:** Does the paper's organization serve the argument? Are
  transitions logical?
- **Narrative craft:** Is the writing engaging? Does the prose do justice to
  the ethnographic material?
- **Economy:** Is the paper the right length for its content, or is there
  padding, redundancy, or unnecessary throat-clearing?

### Contribution

- **Novelty:** What does this paper add that did not exist before?
- **Significance:** Does the contribution matter to anyone beyond the author?
  Who would change their thinking or practice because of this work?
- **Durability:** Is this a contribution that will remain relevant, or is it
  tied to a momentary trend?

## Constructive Feedback Patterns

### The Strength-Concern-Suggestion Pattern

For each major issue, structure feedback in three moves:

1. **Acknowledge what the author is trying to do** (or what works in the
   current approach).
2. **Identify the specific concern** and explain why it matters for the
   paper's goals.
3. **Suggest a concrete path forward** that preserves the author's project
   while addressing the problem.

**Example:**
> The paper's attention to bureaucratic encounters (strength) is one of its
> most productive elements. However, the analysis of these encounters in
> section 4 relies primarily on the author's observations without
> incorporating how participants themselves understood these interactions
> (concern). Including participant interpretations of bureaucratic encounters
> would strengthen the argument by showing whether the "strategic opacity"
> framework resonates with lived experience or is primarily an analyst's
> category (suggestion).

### Questions vs. Assertions

**Use questions when:**
- You are uncertain whether the issue is real or reflects your misreading
- The concern falls outside your core expertise
- You want to open a dialogue rather than prescribe a fix
- The issue might have an explanation the manuscript did not include

**Use assertions when:**
- The issue is clearly identifiable and supported by evidence in the text
- The problem falls squarely within your expertise
- The concern is factual (e.g., a mischaracterization of another scholar's
  argument)
- The issue is serious enough that hedging would understate its importance

### Evaluating the Paper as Written

One of the most important reviewer skills is distinguishing between what the
paper does and what you wish it did. Your job is to evaluate whether the
manuscript succeeds on its own terms, not whether you would have designed the
project differently.

**Valid critiques:** The paper's chosen approach produces an identifiable
problem (logical gap, unsupported claim, missed implication, internal
contradiction).

**Invalid critiques:** You would have asked a different research question,
used a different theoretical framework, or studied a different population.
These preferences are not bases for revision demands.

**Borderline cases:** When the paper's chosen scope or approach systematically
excludes something the argument needs. In this case, frame the concern as a
question about internal coherence, not as a preference for a different project.

### Epistemic Humility Language

When reviewing outside your full expertise, signal the limits of your
assessment honestly:

- "I am not a specialist in [X] and defer to other reviewers on the adequacy
  of the engagement with that literature."
- "My assessment of the [Y] dimensions of this paper is limited; the comments
  below focus on [Z], where I have more expertise."
- "I raise the following as a question rather than an assertion, since [topic]
  is not my primary area."

### Calibrating Review Depth to Journal Tier

- **AAA flagships:** Full engagement with all six evaluation dimensions.
  Detailed, substantive reviews of 2,000-3,000 words. Hold the paper to the
  highest standards for theoretical contribution and ethnographic depth.
- **Regional journals:** Strong emphasis on area expertise and empirical
  contribution. Moderate length (1,500-2,500 words). Assess local literature
  engagement carefully.
- **Interdisciplinary outlets:** Focus on accessibility, cross-disciplinary
  relevance, and methods transparency. Assess whether a non-anthropologist
  reader can follow the argument.
- **Specialty/open-access:** Assess subfield-specific contribution and
  methodological innovation. Review length varies with journal norms.

### Developmental Reviewing for Early-Career Authors

When you suspect (or know) the author is a graduate student or early-career
scholar:

- Maintain standards but increase scaffolding. The same issue can be flagged
  with more explanation of why it matters and more detailed suggestions for
  how to address it.
- Distinguish between apprenticeship issues (things the author will learn with
  experience, like literature gaps) and fundamental problems (things that
  indicate the project needs rethinking).
- Be explicit about what is working. Early-career authors often cannot tell
  which parts of their manuscript are strong because they have not yet
  developed calibration.
- Point toward resources when relevant: "Engaging with [scholar]'s work on
  [topic] would help strengthen this section" is more useful than "The
  literature review is insufficient."
- Do not condescend. Developmental reviewing means more scaffolding, not a
  different standard.

## Common Review Pitfalls

| Pitfall | What it looks like | Prevention strategy |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Vague praise | "Interesting paper," "rich ethnography," "well-written" | Name the specific passage, argument, or move that works and explain why |
| Vague criticism | "The argument is unclear," "the evidence is thin" | Identify where in the manuscript the problem occurs and what specifically is missing or confusing |
| Destructive tone | "This paper fails to...," "The author does not understand..." | Reframe as constructive: "The paper would benefit from..." or "The connection between X and Y could be strengthened by..." |
| Prescribing a different project | "The paper should have studied X instead" or "Why didn't the author use [my preferred theory]?" | Ask whether the chosen approach produces a specific problem, not whether you prefer a different approach |
| Overloading with citations | Listing 10+ works the author "must" engage | Limit to 2-3 genuinely relevant works and explain briefly why each matters for the argument |
| Conflating major and minor issues | Burying a major conceptual problem in a list of line edits | Separate major and minor issues explicitly; promote any issue that affects the core argument |
| Reviewing the author, not the paper | Commenting on career stage, institutional affiliation, or theoretical "camp" | Focus exclusively on what is on the page; evaluate arguments and evidence, not persons |
| Ignoring the paper's own goals | Evaluating against criteria the paper does not claim to meet | Start from the paper's stated aims and assess whether it achieves them |
| Asymmetric engagement | Spending 90% of the review on critique and 10% on strengths | Allocate roughly equal analytical attention to what works and what needs improvement |
| Scope creep | Demanding revisions that would double the paper's length or fundamentally change its scope | Distinguish between improvements that serve the existing argument and new demands that expand the project |
| Confidentiality breach | Discussing the manuscript with colleagues or sharing its content | Treat the manuscript as confidential from invitation through publication |
| Identity revelation in blind review | References to the author's other work, conference presentations, or institutional context | Write as if you do not know the author's identity, even if you do |

## Review Length and Format Norms

### Length Expectations by Venue

| Journal type | Typical review length | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| AAA flagships | 2,000-3,000 words | Substantive engagement with all dimensions expected |
| Regional journals | 1,500-2,500 words | Emphasis on area expertise and empirical assessment |
| Interdisciplinary | 1,500-2,500 words | Must address accessibility and cross-disciplinary relevance |
| Specialty/open-access | 1,000-2,000 words | Varies by journal; follow any provided guidelines |
| Book reviews | 800-1,500 words | Different genre; not covered in this guide |

### Structured vs. Unstructured Formats

**Structured formats:** Some journals provide a review template with specific
sections or questions. Follow the template. If the template includes a
numerical rating system, provide the rating but always supplement it with
written explanation. A number without a rationale is not a review.

**Unstructured formats:** Most anthropology journals provide no template. Use
the six-part review anatomy described above. The lack of a template is not an
invitation to write stream-of-consciousness impressions.

### Organizing Without a Template

When the journal provides no guidance, use this structure:

1. **Opening paragraph:** Summary demonstrating careful reading (3-5 sentences).
2. **Second paragraph:** Contribution assessment and overall evaluation. State
   your recommendation here so the editor gets the headline early.
3. **Strengths section:** 1-2 paragraphs on what works, with specifics.
4. **Major issues section:** Each issue gets its own paragraph with the
   three-part structure (problem, stakes, suggestion).
5. **Minor issues section:** Numbered list with page/section references.
6. **Closing:** Brief reiteration of the recommendation and any encouraging
   final note (especially for papers recommended for R&R or reject with
   encouragement).

### Confidential Comments to the Editor

Most submission systems include a separate field for comments to the editor
that the author will not see. Use this space for:

- Your recommendation (some journals ask for this only in the confidential
  section)
- Any concerns about ethical issues that you do not want to raise directly
  with the author
- Notes about the limits of your expertise that would help the editor weigh
  your review
- Comments about the manuscript's fit for the journal that would be
  inappropriate in the author-facing review

Do NOT use confidential comments for:
- Substantive critique that the author needs to hear
- An alternative, harsher version of your review
- Gossip about the author or their intellectual community
