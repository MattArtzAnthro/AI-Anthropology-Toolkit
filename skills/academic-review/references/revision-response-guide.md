# Responding to Peer Review: A Guide for Anthropology Journals

## Overview

Receiving a revise-and-resubmit (R&R) is good news. Most published articles go through
at least one round of revision. A well-crafted response letter can be as important as
the revised manuscript itself.

## Rebuttal Letter Structure

### Cover Letter to the Editor

The cover letter should be 200-400 words and accomplish four things:

1. **Thank the editor and reviewers.** One genuine sentence.
2. **Summarize the scope of revisions.** 2-3 sentences on major changes.
3. **Flag points of disagreement.** Briefly note where you maintained your position.
4. **State willingness to revise further.** One closing sentence.

Example:

> Dear [Editor],
>
> Thank you for the opportunity to revise this manuscript and for the thoughtful
> feedback from the reviewers.
>
> In this revision, I have [major change 1], [major change 2], and [major change 3].
> I have also addressed numerous smaller points of clarification throughout.
>
> On one point, I have respectfully maintained my original position regarding
> [brief description], and I explain my reasoning in the detailed response below.
>
> I remain open to further revisions and hope the revised manuscript is now suitable
> for publication in [Journal Name].
>
> Sincerely, [Your Name]

### Point-by-Point Response Format

After the cover letter, respond to every comment from every reviewer:

- **Reviewer comment** quoted or paraphrased (visually distinct)
- Your response describing the action taken
- Reference to the specific location in the revised manuscript

Two common formatting conventions:

**Convention A (Bold/Regular):**

> **Reviewer 1, Comment 3:** "The theoretical framework needs further development."
>
> I have expanded the theoretical discussion in Section 2 (pp. 8-12) to draw more
> explicit connections between practice theory and the ritual practices in Section 4.

**Convention B (Numbered):**

> R1.3: [Reviewer comment]
> A1.3: [Author response]

Choose one and be consistent. Convention B is useful for cross-referencing.

### Organizing for Multiple Reviewers

- Address each reviewer in order
- Follow the order of their comments within each section
- Number every comment, even minor ones
- Cross-reference when reviewers raise overlapping points
- Add a table of contents if the response exceeds 8-10 pages

## Point-by-Point Response Templates

### Agree and Changed

> **Reviewer comment:** [Quoted or paraphrased]
>
> We agree. In the revised manuscript, we have [describe change]. See pp. X-Y.

Keep these concise. Do not over-explain when you simply agree.

### Partially Agree

> **Reviewer comment:** [Quoted or paraphrased]
>
> We appreciate this observation and agree that [valid core of concern]. However,
> [explain why full implementation is not appropriate]. To address the underlying
> concern, we have [describe partial accommodation]. See pp. X-Y.

Validate the concern while explaining your alternative approach.

### Respectfully Disagree

> **Reviewer comment:** [Quoted or paraphrased]
>
> We have given this careful consideration and chosen to maintain [your position]
> for the following reasons: [2-3 specific reasons].
>
> We have revised the language on p. X to make our reasoning more transparent.

Always offer something even when you disagree -- clarifying language, a footnote,
or a brief discussion of limitations.

### Already Addressed

> **Reviewer comment:** [Quoted or paraphrased]
>
> This point is addressed in [Section/page], where we [briefly describe]. We have
> added [clarifying sentence/subheading] to make this more visible. See p. X.

Never respond with just "this is already in the manuscript." If the reviewer missed
it, it was not clear enough.

### Requests to Add Literature

**Relevant source:**

> We have incorporated [Author, Year] into Section X (p. Y), where it strengthens
> our discussion of [topic].

**Tangentially relevant:**

> We have added a brief mention in footnote X to acknowledge this related work
> without diverting from our central argument.

**Not relevant:**

> This work focuses on [different topic/region/method]. Incorporating it would
> require a significant detour from our argument. We have chosen not to include it
> but are happy to reconsider if the reviewer feels strongly.

## Handling Contradictory Feedback

### Read Behind the Comments

Both reviewers may be responding to the same underlying problem. If one says "more
theory" and another says "less theory," the real issue is often that theory and
ethnography are poorly integrated. Ask: what single manuscript problem could produce
both reactions?

### Check the Editor's Letter

Look for signals about which reviewer to weight more heavily:

- "I especially encourage you to attend to Reviewer 1's comments on..." = priority
- Explicit acknowledgment of conflicting feedback may include guidance
- Silence on contradictions gives you more latitude

### Reframe the Contradiction

| Apparent Contradiction | Structural Reframe |
|---|---|
| More theory vs. less theory | Theory-ethnography integration is weak |
| Broader scope vs. deeper focus | The argument's scale is unclear |
| More context vs. get to the point | Introduction does not establish stakes |
| More literature vs. too much literature | Lit review is not well targeted |
| Bolder argument vs. more caution | Claims and evidence are mismatched |

### Find the Single Revision

Look for one revision strategy that satisfies both concerns simultaneously. For the
theory example: restructure so theoretical concepts appear alongside the ethnographic
material they illuminate, rather than adding or removing theory overall.

### When No Synthesis Is Possible

State the contradiction clearly in your response letter, explain what you considered,
describe your reasoned choice, and express openness to the editor's guidance:

> Reviewers 1 and 2 offered different recommendations regarding [issue]. After
> careful consideration, we followed Reviewer [N]'s recommendation because [reason].
> We are open to further guidance from the editor.

## Revision Planning Framework

### Triage All Comments

Before making changes, categorize every comment:

| Category | Description | Typical Proportion |
|---|---|---|
| **(a) Agree and change** | Implement the suggestion | 50-70% |
| **(b) Partially agree** | Valid concern, different solution | 15-25% |
| **(c) Disagree and defend** | Maintain position with reasoning | 5-15% |

If category (c) exceeds 20%, reconsider whether you are being sufficiently open.

### Prioritize by Importance

Major issues first: central argument, theoretical framework, methodological concerns,
structural organization, significant empirical gaps. Minor issues (citation format,
word choice) in a final pass.

### Map Changes to Manuscript Sections

| Section | Changes Needed | Comments | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Introduction | Rewrite opening, sharpen thesis | R1.1, R2.3 | In progress |
| Literature Review | Add 3 sources, cut tangent | R1.4, R2.1 | Not started |
| Methods | Expand positionality | R1.7, R2.5 | Complete |
| Ethnography Ch. 1 | Integrate theory | R1.2, R2.2 | Not started |
| Conclusion | Broaden implications | R1.9 | Not started |

This prevents revising sections multiple times and missing comments that apply to
sections you thought were finished.

### Create a Revision Timeline

- **Minor revisions:** 2-6 weeks
- **Major revisions:** 2-6 months
- **Full R&R:** 3-9 months

Build backward from the deadline: Week 1 for triage and planning, middle weeks for
substantive revision (hardest sections first), then response letter drafting,
proofreading, and formatting.

### Track Changes and Version Control

- Use track changes (most journals require this)
- Keep clean and tracked copies side by side
- Name files with dates or version numbers
- Back up in at least two locations

---

## R&R Success Patterns

**Respond within the deadline.** Request extensions before the deadline, not after.

**Address every single point.** No skipping. A skipped comment signals carelessness.

**Show substantial engagement.** Restructure sections, not just add sentences. Engage
with the substance of critiques, not just surface requests.

**Use revision summary tables:**

| Comment | Category | Action | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1.1 | Agree | Revised introduction | pp. 1-3 |
| R1.2 | Partial | Added bridging paragraphs | pp. 8, 15 |
| R1.3 | Disagree | Clarified reasoning | p. 12, fn. 4 |
| R2.1 | Agree | Added three sources | pp. 6-7 |

**Treat the response letter as a persuasive document.** The editor reads it before
(or alongside) the revised manuscript. A convincing letter sets a favorable
disposition toward the revision.

## Common Revision Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Prevention |
|---|---|
| Skipping a comment because it seems minor | Respond to every point, even briefly |
| Defensive or combative tone | Draft, then revise for tone the next day |
| Only cosmetic changes | Address hardest comments before easy ones |
| Addressing comments in isolation | Map all comments first; find overlaps |
| No time for proofreading | Build proofreading into the timeline |
| Manuscript bloat from additions | For every addition, identify material to cut |
| Over-revising minor points | Match revision scale to concern scale |
| Stale bibliography | Final bibliography check as last step |
| Ignoring the editor's letter | Read it first; it sets priorities |
| Missing tracked changes file | Use a submission checklist |

## Tone Calibration

### Professional Gratitude

Thank each reviewer once at the start of their section. You do not need to express
gratitude for every individual comment. Avoid sycophancy ("profoundly grateful for
this transformative insight") and excessive casualness ("Thanks").

### Confidence Without Defensiveness

**Defensive:** "The reviewer is incorrect about our sample size. We clearly stated
on page 7 that..."

**Confident:** "We appreciate this concern about sample size. As discussed on page 7,
our sample of 35 participants reflects the scope of the community. We have added a
note on p. 8 explaining alignment with standard ethnographic practice."

### Handling Harsh or Unfair Reviews

1. Wait at least 48 hours before drafting your response
2. Separate the valid points from the problematic tone
3. Respond to substance, not tone
4. A measured response to a hostile review speaks for itself

### When to Contact the Editor

Contact the editor before writing your full response if a review contains personal
attacks, a reviewer appears to have a conflict of interest, reviews are irreconcilably
contradictory, or a reviewer requests changes that would make it a different project.
Frame the email as a request for guidance, not a complaint.

## Journal Resubmission vs. New Submission

### Revise for the Same Journal When:

- You received an explicit R&R (not a rejection)
- Requested changes are feasible within your project's scope
- You agree with the general direction of feedback
- The journal remains a good fit for the revised article

### Submit Elsewhere When:

- Reviews suggest the article is not a fit for the journal's scope
- Requested changes would require a fundamentally different article
- You received a rejection (even a soft one)
- The timeline does not work for career needs (tenure clock, etc.)

### Using Reviews from Journal A at Journal B

Use rejected reviews to identify weaknesses any reviewer would notice, strengthen
the manuscript, and preempt likely critiques. Do not mention prior review elsewhere
in your new cover letter.

### Reject with Encouragement

Language like "we encourage you to submit future work" or "a substantially revised
version could be considered as a new submission" means the article was not accepted
but the editor sees potential. A new submission goes through full review again and
should reflect major changes, not minor ones.
