# Writing a Standalone Research Plan

A research plan is a forward-looking argument for feasibility, rigor, and
ethical legitimacy. It is the foundational document from which proposals,
prospectuses, and grant applications are derived. A good research plan can
stand alone — it articulates what you are studying, why it matters, how you
will do it, and why anyone should believe you can pull it off.

The audience for a standalone plan varies: it may be yourself (as a thinking
tool), a committee, a department fieldwork review, or a collaborating partner.
Adapt register accordingly, but never sacrifice precision for accessibility.

## Architecture of a Strong Plan

The most effective plans follow a front-loaded clarity structure: state the
core argument up front, justify it in the middle, demonstrate feasibility at
the end. This matches how reviewers actually read under time pressure.

### Section 1: Overview (0.5–1 page)

State what you will study, why it matters, and how you will do it. A reader
who stops after this section should understand the project's intellectual core.

Write this section last. It is the hardest to get right because it requires
compressing the full argument. But it appears first because reviewers use it
to orient everything that follows.

**What belongs here:**
- The research problem in 2-3 sentences — what phenomenon, where, why now
- Research questions (typically 2-4)
- Core method(s) in one sentence
- The contribution in one sentence — what this study adds

**What does NOT belong here:**
- Your biography or how you became interested
- Extended theoretical framing
- Methodological details

### Section 2: Research Problem and Questions (1–2 pages)

This section does three things:

1. **Names the phenomenon.** What is happening in the world that demands
   investigation? Be concrete. "The global rise of precarious labor" is too
   broad. "How gig platform drivers in Jakarta navigate a regulatory vacuum
   that classifies them as neither employees nor entrepreneurs" is a
   phenomenon.

2. **Establishes the stakes.** Why does this matter — to the people involved,
   to scholarly understanding, to policy, to theory? The stakes should be
   genuine, not inflated. Not everything is "urgent" or "unprecedented."

3. **States the research questions.** Questions should be:
   - Empirically researchable (answerable through fieldwork, not philosophy)
   - Epistemically matched to the study's stance
   - Bounded enough for the available time and resources
   - Productive beyond the specific case

   Most plans have one overarching question and 2-3 sub-questions that
   specify different dimensions of the phenomenon.

### Section 3: Conceptual and Empirical Context (2–4 pages)

This is not a comprehensive literature review. It is a focused argument for
why existing scholarship has not adequately addressed your questions and how
your study fills that gap.

**Structure this as an argument, not a survey:**
- What do we know about this phenomenon? (empirical literature)
- What theoretical tools have been used to understand it? (conceptual
  frameworks)
- Where are the gaps, tensions, or inadequacies? (the opening your study
  addresses)
- How does your theoretical orientation position you to see what others have
  missed? (your intervention)

**Common failure modes:**
- Listing sources instead of engaging them analytically
- Reviewing literature that is only tangentially related
- Claiming a gap without showing why it matters
- Name-dropping theorists without showing how their concepts shape your design

**Theoretical framework considerations by epistemic family:**

For *interpretive/hermeneutic/phenomenological* projects: Show how your
framework enables you to access meaning, experience, or interpretation that
existing work has treated superficially or from the outside.

For *critical/political economy/postcolonial* projects: Show how your
framework reveals power relations, structural conditions, or historical
formations that existing work naturalizes or ignores.

For *STS/infrastructure/material* projects: Show how your framework attends
to nonhuman actors, material arrangements, or technical systems that existing
work treats as background.

For *applied/design/organizational* projects: Show how your framework
connects analytical insight to actionable change in ways existing work
does not.

### Section 4: Field Site(s) and Access (1–2 pages)

Explain where the research takes place and why.

**"Why here?" must be answered explicitly.** The field site is not arbitrary.
It should be the place where your research questions can best be investigated.
Justify the site in terms of the phenomenon (this is where the thing happens),
the analytical leverage (this site illuminates dynamics that other sites would
not), and the practical feasibility (you can actually get there and work).

**Access is an argument, not an assumption.** Specify:
- Existing relationships or institutional affiliations at the site
- Permissions needed and their status (in hand, in progress, planned)
- Language competencies and how gaps will be addressed
- Prior visits or preliminary research, if any

**For multi-sited or digital research:** Justify why multiple sites or
digital platforms are necessary for your questions. Explain how you will
manage the practical challenges of moving between sites or tracing connections
across platforms. Multi-sited research is not "more is better" — it must
serve the analytical design.

**Contingency planning.** What happens if access falls through? Political
instability, organizational gatekeepers, visa issues, platform policy changes
— all are real risks. A credible plan acknowledges them and describes
fallback strategies.

### Section 5: Methods and Data Generation (2–3 pages)

Specify the methods and justify each one in terms of what it contributes to
answering your questions. Do not list methods; argue for them.

**For each method, explain:**
- What kind of evidence it generates
- Why that evidence is necessary for your questions
- How you will implement it practically (not just "interviews" but how many,
  with whom, selected how, structured how)
- How it relates to your other methods (triangulation, complementarity,
  sequencing)

**Sampling and recruitment.** Even in ethnographic research, sampling
decisions should be explicit:
- Who will you talk to, observe, follow, or study?
- How will you identify and recruit participants?
- What is your sampling logic? (purposive, snowball, theoretical, maximum
  variation, etc.)
- How many participants or sites is realistic? Justify this — not with a
  statistical formula, but with a methodological rationale tied to your
  questions and design.

**Data types and management.** Specify what data you will generate:
- Fieldnotes (structured? unstructured? frequency?)
- Interview recordings and transcripts
- Documents, archival materials, digital traces
- Visual or sensory data
- Surveys or structured instruments

Address where data will be stored, how it will be secured, and who will have
access. This is increasingly required by funders and institutions, and good
practice regardless.

### Section 6: Analysis Plan (1–2 pages)

Specify how you will move from raw materials to findings. Vague analysis
plans are the most common reviewer critique in qualitative proposals.

**Include:**
- Analytic approach (thematic analysis, grounded theory coding, discourse
  analysis, narrative analysis, etc.) and why it fits your questions
- Documentation practices — how will you maintain an audit trail of analytic
  decisions? (memoing, codebook evolution, decision logs)
- How analysis and data collection will interact — ethnographic research is
  typically iterative, with analysis beginning during fieldwork. Describe
  this relationship.
- What would a "finding" look like for this study? What form will your
  arguments take?

**Avoid:**
- Claiming you will use grounded theory if you already have a theoretical
  framework (grounded theory is theory-generating, not theory-applying —
  though constructivist GT allows more starting frameworks)
- Listing analysis software as a substitute for describing analytic logic
- Leaving analysis entirely to "emerge from the data" — even inductive
  approaches have procedures and decision points

### Section 7: Reflexivity and Positionality (0.5–1 page)

Address how your social position, institutional location, and relationships
to the community and topic shape the research. This is not a confessional
autobiography. It is an analytical statement about how your location affects:
- What you can access and what remains invisible
- How participants may perceive and relate to you
- What interpretive lenses you bring and what they reveal or obscure
- What concrete steps you will take to manage positionality's effects

For research involving power differentials (studying "up" at elites, or
"down" at marginalized communities), positionality discussion is especially
important and should be integrated into methods and ethics, not siloed.

### Section 8: Trustworthiness and Transparency (0.5–1 page)

Specify your strategies for ensuring credibility, transferability,
dependability, and confirmability. These are not decorative — they are
practices built into your design:

- **Credibility:** Prolonged engagement, triangulation across methods or
  sources, member checking where appropriate, searching for disconfirming
  evidence
- **Transferability:** Thick description that enables readers to assess
  applicability to other contexts
- **Dependability:** Audit trail of decisions, consistent (not rigid)
  procedures, documentation of methodological pivots
- **Confirmability:** Reflexive journaling, transparency about interpretive
  choices, distinguishing observation from inference from interpretation

### Section 9: Ethics and Governance (1–2 pages)

Ethics in anthropology extend far beyond IRB compliance. Address:

- **Consent strategy.** Will it be written, oral, processual, community-level,
  or some combination? Justify the choice based on context. Written consent
  forms may be inappropriate or even dangerous in some settings.
- **Confidentiality and de-identification.** How will you protect participants?
  What are the limits of confidentiality in small communities or identifiable
  settings?
- **Potential harms.** What could go wrong for participants, communities, or
  you? How will you mitigate these risks? "Do no harm" requires anticipation,
  not just reaction.
- **Data governance.** Ownership, access, sharing, retention, and disposal.
  For Indigenous data, engage CARE principles alongside FAIR.
- **Community obligations.** How will findings be returned to participants or
  communities? What reciprocity is appropriate?
- **Dissemination ethics.** What should not be published, even if analytically
  interesting? Who gets to review findings before publication?

### Section 10: Feasibility (1–2 pages)

Demonstrate that you can actually do this. Feasibility is a realism test.

- **Preparation completed.** Language study, preliminary visits, training,
  institutional affiliations, letters of support.
- **Timeline.** Month-by-month or phase-by-phase schedule. Be honest about
  how long things take — IRB review, travel, settling in, relationship
  building, recruitment, data collection, analysis, writing. A tabular
  timeline is often more readable than prose.
- **Budget.** If relevant, include a realistic budget. Reviewers use budgets
  to assess whether you understand the actual costs of the work. Round
  numbers signal guessing.
- **Personnel.** If you will have research assistants, translators, or
  collaborators, describe their roles.

### Bibliography

Use a standard format appropriate for your discipline (AAA style, Chicago,
APA). Include works cited in the plan, not a comprehensive reading list.

## Formatting Principles

1. **Use headings that match evaluation criteria.** If a committee or funder
   expects specific sections, name your headings accordingly so reviewers can
   locate required elements quickly.

2. **Make the analytic chain visible.** Research question → methods → sampling
   → analysis → trustworthiness. A reviewer should be able to trace this chain
   through the document without hunting.

3. **Use tables sparingly but strategically.** Timelines, method-to-question
   mapping, and sampling frameworks often read more clearly as tables than
   prose.

4. **Respect page limits.** If a venue specifies page limits, formatting rules,
   or font requirements, follow them exactly. Do not game margins or font size.

## Adapting to Specific Audiences

**Departmental fieldwork review:** Emphasis on risk management, practical
preparedness, and ethical clearance status. Cambridge-style reviews want
to see that you have thought through what can go wrong.

**Committee review (prospectus defense):** Emphasis on intellectual readiness
— theoretical sophistication, command of the literature, clarity of the
research design. More room for honest uncertainty about findings.

**Funder review:** Emphasis on contribution (intellectual merit), feasibility,
and broader impacts. Persuasive efficiency matters — every sentence should
advance the case. See funder-specific reference files for detailed guidance.

**Community partners:** Emphasis on mutual benefit, practical deliverables,
and accessible language. The research plan is also a relationship document.
