  anthropology," "translating research," "accessible writing," "plain language,"
  "policy brief," "community summary," or "media training." Covers public-facing
  writing (blog posts, op-eds, popular press), podcast and media preparation,
  community summaries and return-of-results documents, and register translation
  from academic to accessible language. Do NOT use for academic conference
  presentations (use conference-materials skill), peer-reviewed article writing,
  or grant proposals (use grant-proposal skill).

# Public Engagement & Communication

Help anthropologists communicate research to non-academic audiences across
formats and platforms. This skill treats public engagement as register
translation — converting academic knowledge into accessible communication
without oversimplification or loss of nuance. The goal is not to strip away
complexity but to repackage it for audiences who have not spent years in your
subfield's conversations.

Public engagement is not "dumbing down" — it is a different rhetorical genre
with its own craft requirements. Op-eds need a clear take, not a balanced
literature review. Community reports need actionable findings, not hedged
conclusions. Podcast prep needs soundbites that don't distort. Each format
demands different skills, and the failure modes are different from academic
writing. The most common mistake is treating public writing as academic
writing with the jargon removed — it is not. It has its own architectures,
its own narrative logics, and its own standards of evidence presentation.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify What the User Needs

Determine the entry point. Public engagement spans several distinct genres,
and the user may need one or several:

- **Public writing.** The user wants to write an op-ed, blog post, essay
  for a popular outlet (Sapiens, The Conversation, Aeon), or other
  public-facing text based on their research. Load the public writing guide.
- **Community report or return of results.** The user needs to communicate
  findings back to research participants, community partners, or
  stakeholders. This is a reciprocity obligation, not just a dissemination
  task. Load the community engagement guide.
- **Media preparation.** The user has an interview, podcast appearance, or
  media event and needs talking points, soundbite preparation, or interview
  coaching. Load the media preparation guide.
- **Register translation.** The user has existing academic text (a journal
  article, dissertation chapter, conference paper) and wants to translate
  it into accessible language for a specific audience. Load the public
  writing guide and focus on the register translation sections.
- **Policy brief.** The user needs to communicate research findings to
  policymakers in a concise, action-oriented format. Load the community
  engagement guide and focus on the policy brief sections.
- **Combined request.** The user needs multiple outputs (e.g., a blog post
  and talking points for a related podcast). Load the relevant reference
  files for each output type.

Ask the user if not immediately clear:
- **Which audience?** General public, community members/participants,
  policymakers, educated non-specialists, media professionals.
- **Which platform or outlet?** Blog, op-ed page, The Conversation, Sapiens,
  podcast, local news, policy brief, community meeting.
- **What is the purpose?** Knowledge sharing, advocacy, reciprocity/return
  of results, public scholarship, community accountability.

### Step 2: Gather Context

Collect the information needed to produce effective public-facing content.
Not all of this is needed upfront — gather what you can and note gaps for
the user to fill.

**Essential context (cannot proceed without these):**
- The research findings or knowledge to be communicated — what does the
  user want the audience to understand or act on? Push for specificity:
  not "my research on migration" but "what my research reveals about why
  families choose dangerous routes."
- The target audience — who will read, hear, or receive this? Audience
  determines register, format, length, and what background to assume.
- The platform or outlet — each has its own norms, word counts, editorial
  processes, and audience expectations.

**Important context (strengthens the output significantly):**
- Community relationships and obligations — does the user have commitments
  to share findings with participants? Are there co-authorship or
  review agreements?
- Ethical constraints on what can be shared — what did participants consent
  to? Are there findings that should not be made public? Are there
  identifiability risks in public writing?
- Consent boundaries — some findings may be shareable in academic contexts
  but not appropriate for public dissemination. Clarify before drafting.
- The "so what" — why does this matter to non-academic audiences? What is
  the stake for the reader, listener, or community member?

**Helpful context (improves tailoring):**
- Prior public writing or media experience — is the user new to this or
  experienced? This shapes how much scaffolding to provide.
- Media contacts or outlet relationships — has the user pitched before?
  Do they have an editor contact?
- Timeline — is this for a timely news hook, or a slower feature piece?
- Career stage — junior scholars may need more guidance on navigating
  public visibility and its professional implications.

### Step 3: Load Appropriate References

- **For public writing** (op-eds, blogs, popular articles, register
  translation): Load `references/public-writing-guide.md` for platform
  formats, narrative structures, register translation principles, pitching
  strategies, and ethical considerations.
- **For community engagement** (return of results, community reports,
  policy briefs): Load `references/community-engagement-guide.md` for
  reciprocity frameworks, report structures, consent boundaries, plain
  language principles, and community review processes.
- **For media preparation** (podcasts, interviews, talking points): Load
  `references/media-preparation-guide.md` for talking point development,
  interview techniques, soundbite crafting, and post-interview strategies.
- **For combined requests**: Load all relevant reference files.

### Step 4: Generate Content

Follow the audience-first principle across all formats:

**For public writing:**
- Start with the hook — why should a non-specialist care about this?
  Lead with the human story, the surprising finding, or the urgent stake.
  Do not lead with the literature gap.
- Translate findings into concrete, vivid language. Replace "livelihood
  diversification strategies" with "the ways families piece together a
  living." Replace "structural violence" with a description of the
  structures and the harm they cause, then name the concept.
- Build around a clear "so what" — every public piece needs a take,
  a position, or an implication that matters beyond the academy.
- Match the platform's conventions: word count, tone, structure, editorial
  expectations.

**For community reports:**
- Center community priorities — what do participants and partners want
  to know? This may not match what the researcher finds most interesting.
- Use plain language throughout — aim for an 8th-grade reading level
  for general community audiences. Define any technical terms that must
  be included.
- Include actionable information — what can community members do with
  these findings? What are the next steps?
- Build in community voice — quotes from participants (with consent),
  community responses to findings, space for disagreement.

**For media preparation:**
- Develop three key messages — what are the three things the audience
  must take away? Everything else is supporting material.
- Craft soundbites — memorable, accurate, quotable statements that can
  stand alone if extracted from context.
- Prepare for hostile or uninformed questions — bridge phrases, redirect
  techniques, and strategies for correcting mischaracterization without
  appearing defensive.

**For register translation:**
- Work paragraph by paragraph through the academic text, identifying
  jargon, passive constructions, hedging, and implicit assumptions.
- Replace or define jargon. Some terms are necessary and should be defined;
  others are substitutable with plain language.
- Restructure from academic logic (gap-theory-method-finding) to public
  logic (hook-finding-stake-implication).

### Step 5: Generate Output

Produce one or more of these deliverables depending on user needs:

- **Op-ed.** 600-800 words with a clear hook, argument, evidence, and
  call to action. Include a suggested headline and author bio line.
- **Blog post.** 600-1500 words with a narrative opening, research
  findings in accessible language, and a clear "why it matters" section.
- **Popular article pitch.** A pitch email for a specific outlet (Sapiens,
  The Conversation, Aeon, etc.) with the angle, the hook, why now, and
  why this author.
- **Community report.** Executive summary, key findings in plain language,
  implications for the community, next steps, and space for community
  response. Format appropriate to the audience (full report, one-page
  brief, presentation slides, or pamphlet).
- **Policy brief.** 2-4 pages with an executive summary, key findings,
  policy implications, and specific recommendations.
- **Talking points.** Three key messages with supporting evidence, bridge
  phrases, anticipated questions with response frameworks, and one strong
  soundbite per key message.
- **Podcast/interview prep sheet.** Background on the outlet and
  interviewer, key messages, likely questions, bridging strategies, and
  a one-paragraph "elevator pitch" of the research.
- **Register translation.** The user's academic text rewritten for a
  specified audience and platform, with tracked changes showing what
  was modified and why.

### Step 6: Quality Check

Before presenting the output, verify:

- [ ] **Accessibility:** Would a non-specialist understand the main point
  without any background in anthropology? Is jargon eliminated or
  defined? Is the reading level appropriate for the audience?
- [ ] **Accuracy:** Does the accessible version faithfully represent the
  research? Has oversimplification introduced distortion? Are any claims
  stronger or weaker than the evidence supports?
- [ ] **Appropriate register:** Does the writing match the platform's
  conventions? An op-ed should sound like an op-ed, not a journal article
  with the citations removed.
- [ ] **Consent boundaries respected:** Does any content risk identifying
  participants? Does the public version share only what participants
  consented to have shared publicly? Are there findings that should
  remain in academic channels?
- [ ] **Clear "so what":** Can a reader or listener identify in one
  sentence why this matters to them? Is there a concrete stake, not
  just "this is interesting"?
- [ ] **Platform compliance:** Does the output meet the target platform's
  word count, format, and style requirements?
- [ ] **Community priorities centered:** For community reports, does the
  document address what the community wants to know, not just what the
  researcher wants to report?
- [ ] **Soundbite accuracy:** For media preparation, can each soundbite
  stand alone without distorting the research? Would the researcher be
  comfortable seeing it quoted out of context?

## Parameters

- **Audience:** General public (assume no background knowledge), community
  members/participants (may have lived expertise but not academic framing),
  policymakers (assume busy, want actionable recommendations), educated
  non-specialists (e.g., readers of Sapiens or Aeon — curious, literate,
  but not anthropologists), media professionals (need clear angles and
  quotable statements).
- **Platform:** Blog (personal or institutional), op-ed (newspaper opinion
  pages), The Conversation (academic-accessible hybrid with disclosure
  requirements), Sapiens (long-form anthropology for public audiences),
  Aeon (intellectual essays), podcast/radio, local media (newspaper, TV),
  policy brief, community report, social media thread, zine/pamphlet.
- **Purpose:** Knowledge sharing (making research accessible), advocacy
  (research in service of a position), reciprocity (returning findings to
  participants and communities), public scholarship (building a public
  intellectual profile), community accountability (reporting back on
  commitments made during research).
- **Register level:** General public (8th-grade reading level, no jargon,
  concrete language), educated non-specialist (can handle complexity but
  not disciplinary vocabulary), community stakeholder (may have deep
  contextual knowledge but not academic framing), policymaker (concise,
  evidence-focused, recommendation-oriented).

## Guardrails

- **Do not share findings that participants have not consented to public
  dissemination.** Academic publications and public writing have different
  audiences and different risks. A finding published in a journal with
  limited readership may be appropriate there but harmful if amplified
  in a blog post or news article. Always verify consent boundaries
  before drafting public content.
- **Do not oversimplify to the point of distortion.** Flag when a claim
  cannot be made accessible without losing essential nuance. Some findings
  are genuinely complex, and the honest move is to say "this is
  complicated" rather than to flatten it into a misleading soundbite.
  Offer the user options: a more nuanced version (longer) or a
  simplified version with caveats noted.
- **Community reports must reflect community priorities, not just
  researcher interests.** Ask the user what their community partners want
  to know. The most academically interesting finding may not be the most
  relevant to the community. If the user does not know what the community
  wants, flag this as a gap and suggest a community consultation step
  before drafting.
- **Media preparation must include strategies for correcting
  misquotation or mischaracterization.** Public engagement creates
  vulnerability — words can be taken out of context, simplified by
  editors, or misquoted. Include bridge phrases, redirect techniques,
  and post-interview correction strategies in all media prep materials.
- **Op-eds need a clear "so what."** Not just "my research found X" but
  "my research shows why Y matters for Z." If the user cannot articulate
  the stake for a non-academic audience, help them find it before
  drafting. An op-ed without a take is an essay without a purpose.
- **Do not fabricate quotes or data.** Use only what the user provides.
  If illustrative examples are needed and the user has not provided them,
  use clear placeholders (e.g., "[participant quote about X]") rather
  than invented material.
- **Respect the distinction between public scholarship and activism.**
  Public writing can be advocacy-oriented, but the user should make that
  choice deliberately. Do not assume that all public engagement is
  advocacy, and do not strip the advocacy out of work that is
  intentionally engaged.
- **Flag professional risks for junior scholars.** Public engagement can
  be professionally risky for untenured scholars — backlash, dismissal
  as "not serious," or time diverted from publications that "count." If
  the user is early career, note these considerations without
  discouraging engagement.

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure mode | Prevention |
|---|---|
| Academic tone in public writing — passive voice, hedging, literature review structure transplanted into a blog post | Rewrite in active voice, first person where appropriate; lead with the finding or story, not the gap in the literature |
| Jargon without definition — "neoliberal governmentality," "ontological turn," "biopolitics" dropped without explanation | Define or replace every technical term; if a term is essential, define it in plain language on first use |
| No clear stake — the piece describes research but never explains why anyone outside the discipline should care | Require a "so what" statement in the first or second paragraph; every public piece must answer "why does this matter to you?" |
| Community report that serves the researcher — reports what the researcher finds interesting rather than what the community needs to know | Ask explicitly what community partners want to learn; structure around community questions, not research questions |
| Oversimplification that distorts — a complex finding flattened into a misleading headline or soundbite | Flag when simplification crosses into distortion; offer the user a "nuanced version" and a "simplified version with caveats" |
| Consent boundary violation — sharing stories, quotes, or identifiable details that participants did not consent to have made public | Check consent scope before drafting; default to more restrictive interpretation; composite or anonymized examples when needed |
| Reading from a script in media — talking points treated as a script rather than a preparation framework, resulting in stilted delivery | Frame talking points as key messages to internalize, not text to recite; include practice exercises for conversational delivery |
| Missing the news hook — pitching a timely piece too late, or writing an op-ed that has no connection to current events or debates | Identify the news hook or public conversation the piece enters; if no hook exists, consider whether a blog or feature is a better format |

## Examples

**Example 1: Op-ed for a newspaper opinion page**

Input: "I want to write an op-ed about my research on maternal health
in rural Guatemala. There's a new WHO report on maternal mortality that
just came out, and I think my fieldwork findings complicate the report's
recommendations. I've been doing ethnographic research for three years in
two highland communities."

Output approach: Load the public writing guide. Set parameters: audience =
general public; platform = op-ed (newspaper); purpose = public scholarship
with advocacy dimensions; register = general public. Identify the news
hook — the WHO report provides a timely entry point. Structure the op-ed
(~700 words): open with a vivid fieldwork scene that illustrates the gap
between policy recommendations and lived reality (not "my research
examines" — show, don't tell). Second paragraph: the WHO report and its
recommendations. Third paragraph: what the report gets wrong or misses,
grounded in ethnographic evidence. Fourth paragraph: why this matters —
the real consequences of policy that does not account for local realities
(specific examples from fieldwork, with identities protected). Fifth
paragraph: what should be done differently — a concrete recommendation
or reframing. Close with a return to the human story. Include a suggested
headline, an author bio line, and a note on which outlets to pitch to
(newspapers with health or global affairs coverage, or outlets like The
Guardian's global development section). Flag: verify that any patient
stories or community details shared in the op-ed fall within consent
boundaries for public dissemination.

**Example 2: Community report and return of results**

Input: "I've finished a two-year CBPR project with a Somali immigrant
community in Minneapolis studying barriers to healthcare access. The
community advisory board wants a report they can share with community
members and use in advocacy with the city health department. I also need
a shorter version for the health department directly."

Output approach: Load the community engagement guide. Set parameters:
audience = community members (primary), policymakers (secondary); platform
= community report (full) + policy brief (short version); purpose =
reciprocity and advocacy; register = general public for the community
report, policymaker for the policy brief. For the community report:
structure around the questions the community advisory board identified as
priorities (not the researcher's academic research questions). Executive
summary in plain language (one page). Key findings presented with
community voice — include participant quotes (with consent), community
advisory board interpretations, and space for disagreement or additional
context. Implications section focused on what the community can do with
the findings. Next steps section co-developed with the advisory board.
Accessible formatting: large font, visual aids, translated sections if
needed (confirm languages). For the policy brief: 2-3 pages, executive
summary with three bullet-point recommendations, evidence summary linking
each recommendation to specific findings, implementation considerations.
Formal but accessible register appropriate for city health department
staff. Both documents should be reviewed by the community advisory board
before distribution — include a note about the review process and
timeline.

**Example 3: Podcast preparation and talking points**

Input: "I've been invited on a popular science podcast to talk about my
research on how conspiracy theories spread in online communities. The
host is a science journalist and the audience is educated non-specialists.
The episode is next week and I'm nervous — I've never done a podcast
before. My research is based on 18 months of digital ethnography."

Output approach: Load the media preparation guide. Set parameters:
audience = educated non-specialists; platform = podcast; purpose =
knowledge sharing / public scholarship; register = educated non-specialist
(can handle complexity, but not disciplinary vocabulary). Develop three
key messages: (1) what the researcher actually found (the surprising or
counterintuitive finding that will hook listeners), (2) why it matters
beyond the academic context (implications for how we think about
misinformation, public health, democratic participation), (3) what the
researcher's approach reveals that other approaches miss (the value of
ethnographic attention to meaning-making rather than just information
flow). For each key message, craft one strong soundbite — a memorable,
accurate, quotable statement that could be pulled for a clip or social
media promotion. Prepare anticipated questions: "Aren't conspiracy
theorists just irrational?" (bridge to complexity of belief systems),
"What should platforms do about this?" (bridge to what the research
shows vs. policy prescriptions), "How did you study this?" (opportunity
to explain digital ethnography accessibly). Include bridge phrases for
redirecting away from oversimplification ("That's a common assumption,
but what I found is...") and strategies for the "well actually" trap
(avoid lecturing; tell stories instead). Provide a one-paragraph
elevator pitch for the research, and a pre-interview checklist: research
the host's style, listen to two previous episodes, identify the
audience's likely prior knowledge, prepare an opening anecdote. Note
first-time podcast advice: speak in shorter sentences than feels
natural, pause before answering, it is fine to say "that's a great
question, let me think about that."
