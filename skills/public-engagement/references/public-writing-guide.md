## Register Translation Principles

Register translation is the core skill of public engagement writing. It
is not removing jargon — it is restructuring how knowledge is presented
to match the expectations and entry points of a different audience.

### Academic Register vs. Public Register

| Feature | Academic register | Public register |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Opening move | Literature gap or theoretical puzzle | Human story, surprising finding, or urgent stake |
| Evidence presentation | Methods → data → analysis → hedged claims | Finding first, then "how we know this," then implications |
| Voice | Third person, passive, distanced | First person acceptable, active voice, present tense |
| Sentence length | Complex, subordinate clauses, qualifications embedded | Short sentences (15-20 words average), one idea per sentence |
| Paragraph structure | Topic sentence → evidence → qualification → transition | Hook → point → support → so what |
| Hedging | Extensive ("it appears that," "the data suggest," "may be understood as") | Reduced but honest ("the evidence points to," "in these communities," "what I found") |
| Citations | In-text references, footnotes | Woven into narrative ("researchers at X found," "a recent study showed") |
| Audience assumption | Shared disciplinary vocabulary | No shared vocabulary; define everything or replace it |

### The Jargon Question

Not all jargon is equal. Three categories:

1. **Replaceable jargon.** Terms that have plain-language equivalents
   and add nothing for a public audience. Replace them.
   - "Livelihood diversification strategies" becomes "the ways families
     piece together a living"
   - "Affective labor" becomes "the emotional work of caring for others"
   - "Neoliberal governance" becomes a description of the specific
     policies and their effects, then (optionally) the label

2. **Necessary jargon.** Terms that capture something no plain phrase
   does, and that the audience will benefit from learning. Define them.
   - "Structural violence" — define it on first use: "structural violence,
     a term anthropologists use for the ways that poverty, racism, and
     policy decisions cause suffering as surely as a fist"
   - "Food sovereignty" — "food sovereignty, the principle that
     communities should control their own food systems"

3. **Insider jargon.** Terms that signal disciplinary membership but
   communicate nothing to outsiders. Remove them entirely.
   - "Ontological turn," "thick description" (unless explaining the
     concept), "interlocutors," "the field," "ethnographic encounter"

### Translation Process

For existing academic text, work through this process:

1. **Identify the core finding.** What does this text want the reader to
   know? State it in one sentence using no disciplinary vocabulary.
2. **Find the human story.** What is the concrete, lived experience that
   illustrates the finding? Lead with that, not with the theoretical
   framing.
3. **Restructure the logic.** Academic logic: gap → theory → method →
   finding → contribution. Public logic: hook → finding → evidence →
   stake → implication.
4. **Replace or define jargon.** Go term by term. For each piece of
   disciplinary vocabulary, decide: replace, define, or remove.
5. **Activate the voice.** Convert passive to active. Convert hedges to
   honest directness. Convert third person to first person where it
   strengthens the writing.
6. **Shorten.** Cut sentence length. Cut paragraph length. Cut the piece
   to the platform's word count. Academic prose is almost always too long
   for public platforms.

## Platform-Specific Formats

### Op-Eds (600-800 words)

**Purpose:** Argue a position on a timely issue, informed by research.
An op-ed is not a research summary — it is a persuasive argument that
draws on research evidence.

**Architecture:**
1. **Hook (50-75 words).** Open with a scene, a statistic, or a
   provocative claim. Grab the reader in the first sentence. Do not
   open with "As an anthropologist..." or "My research shows..."
2. **Stake (75-100 words).** Why does this matter right now? Connect
   to a news event, policy debate, or public conversation. This is the
   "why now" paragraph — it justifies the op-ed's existence.
3. **Evidence (200-250 words).** What does your research show? Use 2-3
   concrete examples from fieldwork. Specific stories are more persuasive
   than aggregate claims. Name places (if safe to do so), describe
   scenes, put the reader in the field site.
4. **Counter-argument (75-100 words).** Acknowledge the strongest
   objection to your position and address it. This builds credibility.
   Do not straw-man the opposition.
5. **Recommendation (100-150 words).** What should be done? Be specific.
   "Policymakers should..." or "We need to rethink..." Give the reader
   a concrete takeaway.
6. **Closing (50-75 words).** Return to the human story or the opening
   image. Close the loop. Leave the reader with an emotional resonance,
   not just an intellectual point.

**Tone:** Authoritative but accessible. You are an expert sharing what
you know, not a professor lecturing. First person is standard. Short
paragraphs (2-4 sentences). Strong verbs. No qualifications that
undermine your own authority.

**Pitching:** Op-eds are pitched, not submitted cold. Email the opinion
editor with a 2-3 sentence pitch: the angle, why now, and why you are
the person to write this. Include a one-line bio. Timeliness matters —
pitch within days of the news hook, not weeks.

### The Conversation (800-1000 words)

**Purpose:** Research-based articles written by academics for an educated
general audience. The Conversation provides editorial support and
reaches millions of readers through republication by major news outlets.

**Architecture:**
1. **Accessible opening** that draws the reader in with a question,
   scene, or finding
2. **Research context** — what you studied, where, and how (briefly)
3. **Key findings** — 2-3 main findings presented in accessible language
4. **Why it matters** — implications beyond the academy
5. **Author disclosure** at the end (required by The Conversation —
   funding sources, affiliations, potential conflicts)

**Distinctive features:** The Conversation requires disclosure statements.
All articles go through an editorial process with a professional editor.
Articles can be republished by partner outlets (AP, Washington Post, etc.)
under Creative Commons. The audience is educated but not specialist.

**Pitching:** The Conversation accepts pitches or full drafts. Contact
your regional edition (US, UK, Australia, etc.). They have a specific
interest in research that connects to current events.

### Sapiens (Features: 1500-3000 words)

**Purpose:** Long-form anthropology writing for curious public audiences.
Sapiens publishes features, essays, and commentary that make
anthropological research accessible and engaging.

**Architecture:**
- **Narrative-driven.** Sapiens pieces read like magazine features,
  not research summaries. They tell stories, introduce characters,
  describe scenes.
- **Research woven in.** Findings and analysis are embedded in the
  narrative, not separated into "methods" and "results" sections.
- **The "anthropological lens."** Sapiens pieces show readers how
  thinking anthropologically changes understanding of a familiar
  topic — "you thought X, but when you look at it this way, you see Y."
- **Visual.** Sapiens features typically include photographs, maps,
  or illustrations. Think about visual storytelling from the start.

**Tone:** Engaging, narrative, literary. Think creative nonfiction,
not academic prose. First person is common. Vivid description. Dialogue
where appropriate (with consent).

**Pitching:** Sapiens has a formal pitch process. The pitch should
include the angle, the story you will tell, why it matters to a broad
audience, and what visual materials are available. They pay contributors.

### Blog Posts (600-1500 words)

**Purpose:** Flexible format for personal or institutional blogs. Lower
barrier to entry than other platforms. Good for early-career scholars
building a public voice, for testing ideas before pitching elsewhere,
and for reaching specific communities.

**Architecture varies by purpose:**

*Research summary blog post:*
1. Narrative opening — a scene, question, or finding that hooks the reader
2. What we studied and what we found (accessible language, 2-3 key findings)
3. Why it matters — implications for the audience
4. Optional: "Read more" links to the full paper or related resources

*Commentary/opinion blog post:*
1. The thing that happened (news event, publication, policy change)
2. Why the conventional take is wrong or incomplete
3. What an anthropological perspective reveals
4. What we should do about it or think about differently

*Field dispatch:*
1. A scene from the field that captures something larger
2. What the researcher is learning or grappling with
3. Reflection on the process of research (appropriate for public audiences)

**Tone:** Personal, conversational, but grounded in expertise. Blog
writing is more informal than op-eds. First person is standard. The
researcher's voice and perspective are part of the appeal.

## Narrative Structures for Public Audiences

### The Lede

Every public piece needs a lede — the opening that draws the reader in.
Academic articles start with the literature gap; public writing starts
with a reason to keep reading.

**Types of ledes:**

- **Anecdotal lede.** Open with a specific moment from fieldwork. "Maria
  sat at the kitchen table, sorting through a stack of medical bills
  that arrived in a language she cannot read." Puts the reader in the scene.
- **Surprising fact lede.** Open with a finding that challenges
  assumptions. "The community with the highest rates of diabetes also
  has the most grocery stores." Creates a puzzle the reader wants solved.
- **Question lede.** Open with a question the reader can relate to.
  "What would you do if the government told you your home was about to
  disappear?" Creates identification and curiosity.
- **News hook lede.** Open with a current event and immediately pivot to
  what your research adds. "The WHO's new report on maternal mortality
  paints a hopeful picture. My three years of fieldwork in rural
  Guatemala tell a different story."

### The "So What" Structure

Every public piece must answer: why does this matter to someone who is
not an anthropologist?

1. **The finding.** What did you discover? State it plainly.
2. **The stake.** Who is affected and how? Make the consequences concrete
   and human.
3. **The implication.** What should change — in policy, in public
   understanding, in how we think about this issue?

### The Narrative Arc

Longer pieces (features, Sapiens articles) need a narrative arc:

1. **Opening scene.** Drop the reader into a specific moment.
2. **The question.** What puzzle or tension does this scene raise?
3. **Context.** What does the reader need to know to understand the
   question? Keep this brief.
4. **The journey.** What did the research reveal? Present findings as a
   sequence of discoveries, not a list of results.
5. **The turn.** What was surprising, counterintuitive, or challenging
   about what you found?
6. **The implication.** Why does this matter? What changes if we take
   this seriously?
7. **Closing.** Return to the opening scene or character. Show how the
   story continues.

## Voice and Tone

### Principles

- **Authoritative but not arrogant.** You are sharing expertise, not
  lecturing. "What I found" rather than "what people fail to understand."
- **First person is standard.** "I" and "my research" are expected in
  public writing. The distanced academic voice reads as evasive or cold
  to public audiences.
- **Active voice.** "Families piece together a living" not "Livelihoods
  are diversified through multiple strategies."
- **Short sentences.** Aim for 15-20 words average. Mix lengths for
  rhythm, but break up complex ideas into multiple sentences.
- **Present tense where possible.** "Conspiracy theories spread through
  trust networks" reads as more vivid and immediate than "Conspiracy
  theories were found to spread through trust networks."
- **Concrete over abstract.** Show, don't tell. Instead of "economic
  precarity," describe what it looks like: "not knowing whether there
  will be work tomorrow."

### Common Pitfalls

- **The hedge habit.** Academic training teaches caution. "It may be
  the case that..." "The data suggest that perhaps..." In public
  writing, be direct: "My research shows..." You can be honest about
  uncertainty without undermining every claim.
- **Passive voice.** "It was found that participants experienced..." →
  "Participants told me that..." or "I found that..."
- **Burying the lede.** Starting with the literature gap, theoretical
  framework, or methods before getting to the finding. Lead with what
  you found, then explain how you know.
- **Academic paragraph structure.** Academic paragraphs develop a single
  point over 8-12 sentences. Public paragraphs are 2-4 sentences.
  Break it up.
- **Name-dropping theorists.** "As Foucault argued..." means nothing to
  public audiences. If the idea matters, explain it in plain language.
  The theorist's name adds authority only in academic contexts.

## Working with Editors

### What to Expect

Public outlets have professional editors who will change your writing.
This is normal and collaborative, not adversarial.

- **Structural edits.** The editor may reorganize your piece, move
  paragraphs, or cut sections. This is their expertise — they know
  their audience.
- **Language edits.** Editors will simplify complex sentences, replace
  jargon, and tighten prose. This is register translation at the
  sentence level.
- **Headline writing.** You will rarely write your own headline. Editors
  write headlines for clicks and clarity. The headline may be more
  provocative than you are comfortable with — you can push back, but
  understand that headlines serve a different function than article titles.
- **Fact-checking.** Some outlets fact-check. Be prepared to provide
  sources, data, and verification for claims.

### Navigating Disagreements

- If an edit changes the meaning of your research, flag it specifically
  and explain what is inaccurate. Editors want accuracy.
- If a headline is misleading, propose an alternative rather than just
  objecting. Give the editor something to work with.
- Pick your battles. Style edits are not worth fighting over. Accuracy
  edits are essential.

## Pitching Strategies

### The Pitch Email

A pitch to an opinion editor or features editor should be concise:

1. **Subject line:** Clear, specific, timely. "Pitch: Why the WHO's
   malaria strategy misses what's happening on the ground"
2. **Opening sentence:** The hook. Why now? What is the news peg or
   public conversation this enters?
3. **The angle:** In 2-3 sentences, what is your argument or story?
4. **Your expertise:** One sentence on why you are the person to write
   this. Include relevant credentials and fieldwork experience.
5. **Logistics:** Proposed word count, timeline, any visual materials
   available.

### Timing

- Op-eds tied to news events: pitch within 48-72 hours of the event.
  After a week, the window closes.
- Feature articles: longer lead times (weeks to months). Less dependent
  on news hooks.
- The Conversation: rolling submissions, but timely pieces get priority.
- Sapiens: pitch well in advance. Editorial process takes months.

### Rejection and Persistence

Rejection is normal. Most pitches are rejected. This does not mean the
idea is bad — it may be wrong for the outlet, poorly timed, or
competing with other pieces. Revise and pitch elsewhere. A rejected
op-ed can become a blog post. A rejected feature pitch can become a
Conversation article.

## Ethical Considerations

### Participant Privacy in Public Writing

Public writing reaches audiences that academic publications do not.
Consider:

- **Identifiability increases with vivid detail.** The specific stories
  that make public writing compelling are the same details that can
  identify participants. A "woman in her 40s in a small town in central
  Mexico" may be identifiable to her neighbors even with a pseudonym.
- **Consent scope matters.** Did participants consent to their stories
  being shared with the general public, or only in academic publications?
  These are different audiences with different risks.
- **Composite characters.** When individual stories cannot be shared
  safely, consider composites that combine elements from multiple
  participants. Label them clearly as composites.
- **Community review.** If writing about a community, consider sharing
  drafts with community members before publication. This is both ethical
  and practical — they may catch inaccuracies.

### The Authority Question

Public writing positions you as an expert. Consider:

- **Whose voice is amplified?** Public writing about a community
  amplifies the researcher's voice, not necessarily the community's.
  Look for ways to center community perspectives.
- **Credit and co-authorship.** If community members contributed to the
  knowledge being shared, consider co-authorship or explicit
  acknowledgment in the public piece.
- **The "speaking for" problem.** Be explicit about your positionality
  and the limits of your perspective. "What I learned from..." rather
  than "What these people think..."
