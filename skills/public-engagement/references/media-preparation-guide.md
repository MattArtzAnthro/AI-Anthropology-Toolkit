## Talking Points Development

### The Three Key Messages Framework

Every media appearance should be organized around three key messages.
Three is not arbitrary — it is the upper limit of what an audience
reliably retains from a single segment. More than three and nothing
sticks. Fewer than three and the interview feels thin.

**Developing key messages:**

1. **The finding.** What did your research discover that the audience
   needs to know? State it in one sentence using no disciplinary
   vocabulary. This is the "what."
2. **The stake.** Why does this matter to people who are not
   anthropologists? What is the real-world consequence, the policy
   implication, or the challenge to conventional wisdom? This is
   the "so what."
3. **The insight.** What does your approach — thinking
   anthropologically, doing ethnographic research — reveal that other
   approaches miss? This is the value-add that distinguishes your
   contribution from a poll, a policy report, or a journalist's
   investigation. This is the "what else."

**For each key message, prepare:**
- A one-sentence statement of the message (the claim)
- A 30-second elaboration with one concrete example (the evidence)
- A soundbite — a memorable, quotable version of the message (the hook)
- An anticipated pushback and your response (the defense)

### Soundbite Crafting

A soundbite is a self-contained statement that can be extracted from
the interview and quoted accurately without additional context. Good
soundbites are the currency of media engagement — they get shared,
remembered, and amplified.

**Characteristics of good soundbites:**
- **Short.** 10-15 seconds when spoken aloud (roughly 25-40 words).
- **Self-contained.** Understandable without the surrounding
  conversation.
- **Concrete.** Uses specific language, not abstractions.
- **Memorable.** Uses vivid imagery, contrast, or unexpected framing.
- **Accurate.** Does not distort the research for the sake of impact.

**Soundbite structures:**
- **The contrast.** "We think of X as Y, but what I found is Z."
  Example: "We think of conspiracy theories as a problem of
  misinformation, but what I found is that they spread through the
  same trust networks we rely on for everything else."
- **The number.** Anchor a finding to a specific, surprising number.
  Example: "Families in this community spend an average of 90 minutes
  each way just to see a doctor."
- **The reframe.** Challenge a common assumption. Example: "This is not
  a story about people making bad choices — it is a story about people
  making the best choices available in an impossible situation."
- **The image.** Paint a picture. Example: "When the floodwaters came,
  families had to choose between their home and their grandmother's
  medicine. That is what climate adaptation looks like on the ground."

**Soundbite red flags:**
- Too long (more than 15 seconds) — it will be cut or ignored
- Depends on context to make sense — it will be misunderstood
- Uses jargon — the audience will tune out
- Hedged to meaninglessness — "it may possibly be the case that..."
  is not quotable
- Overstates the finding — if quoted, would it misrepresent your work?

## Interview Preparation

### Pre-Interview Research

Before any media appearance:

1. **Know the outlet.** Read, listen to, or watch previous content.
   What is the outlet's audience? What is its political orientation
   or editorial stance? What level of expertise does the audience have?
2. **Know the interviewer.** Listen to 2-3 previous interviews by this
   host. What is their style — confrontational, conversational,
   educational? Do they interrupt? Do they ask follow-ups? Do they try
   to get guests to say something provocative?
3. **Know the audience.** A popular science podcast audience is
   different from a local news audience. Adjust register, examples,
   and assumed knowledge accordingly.
4. **Know the format.** How long is the segment? Is it live or recorded?
   (Recorded is more forgiving — stumbles can be edited.) Is it audio
   only or video? Will there be other guests?
5. **Know the angle.** Ask the producer or host in advance: what is the
   story they are telling? Where do you fit? This is not about
   controlling the narrative — it is about being prepared.

### Anticipating Questions

Prepare for three categories of questions:

**Questions you want to be asked:**
- These map to your three key messages. Have clear, practiced
  answers ready.

**Questions you expect to be asked:**
- Common interviewer moves: "How did you get into this?" "What
  surprised you?" "What should people do about this?" "Can you tell
  us a story from your research?"
- Prepare brief, engaging answers for each.

**Questions you hope you will not be asked:**
- The controversial angle, the oversimplification, the "but isn't
  this just..." question. Prepare bridge phrases and redirects for
  these. If you have not prepared for the hard questions, they will
  derail you.

### Practice Strategies

- **Say your key messages out loud.** Multiple times. They should
  sound natural, not rehearsed.
- **Record yourself.** Listen for ums, hedging, jargon, and overly
  long answers. Trim ruthlessly.
- **Practice with a colleague.** Have someone ask you the hard questions.
  Practice bridging.
- **Time your answers.** A good interview answer is 30-60 seconds.
  More than 90 seconds and you are losing the audience.

## Podcast and Radio Techniques

### Conversational Tone

Podcasts and radio are intimate media. The listener often feels like
they are eavesdropping on a conversation. Adjust accordingly:

- **Talk to the host, not to an audience.** Imagine you are explaining
  your research to a smart, curious friend over coffee. Not lecturing.
  Not presenting at a conference.
- **Use "you" language.** "You might think that..." or "If you walked
  into this clinic, you would see..." creates engagement.
- **Tell stories.** Stories are the most effective communication tool
  in audio media. A specific, vivid story from your fieldwork is more
  engaging than any set of findings. Choose one strong story that
  illustrates your key message.
- **Be willing to be personal.** Podcast audiences want to connect with
  the person, not just the research. Sharing why you care about this
  topic, what surprised you, or what keeps you up at night is not
  unprofessional — it is good radio.

### Avoiding Academic Speech Patterns

Academic training creates speech habits that do not work in media:

- **The literature review answer.** "Well, Smith (2015) argued X, but
  Jones (2018) showed Y, and building on that, my research..." The
  host and audience do not care about the historiography. Start with
  your finding.
- **The qualification cascade.** "It is important to note that this is
  preliminary, and of course there are many variables, and we should
  be careful not to overstate, but..." Say the thing. Qualify it
  briefly if needed. Move on.
- **The passive dodge.** "It was observed that..." Who observed it?
  You did. Say so. "I found that..." or "What I saw was..."
- **The jargon reflex.** When nervous, academics reach for disciplinary
  vocabulary like a security blanket. If you catch yourself saying
  "interlocutors" on a podcast, stop and translate.
- **The "well, actually."** The impulse to correct every simplification
  makes for terrible radio. Pick the corrections that matter and let
  the rest go.

### Audio-Specific Tips

- **Speak more slowly than feels natural.** Nervousness speeds you up.
  Deliberate pacing sounds confident and gives the listener time to
  absorb.
- **Pause before answering.** A two-second pause sounds thoughtful on
  air, not awkward. It also prevents you from stepping on the host's
  question.
- **Vary your pitch and energy.** Monotone delivery loses listeners.
  Let your genuine enthusiasm for the topic come through.
- **Shorter sentences.** Audio is harder to follow than text. Break
  complex ideas into multiple short sentences.
- **Signpost your structure.** "There are two things I want to say
  about that. First... Second..." helps the listener follow along.

## Handling Challenging Questions

### The Bridge Technique

Bridging is the core skill for managing media interviews. A bridge
moves the conversation from a question you do not want to answer (or
cannot answer well) to a message you do want to deliver.

**Bridge phrase structures:**
- "That is an important question, and what my research really shows
  is..."
- "I understand why people think that, but what I found is actually..."
- "That is one way to look at it. Another way, based on what I
  saw in the field, is..."
- "I cannot speak to that specifically, but what I can tell you is..."
- "What is more important to understand here is..."

**Rules for bridging:**
- Acknowledge the question briefly. Do not ignore it — that looks
  evasive.
- Pivot to your key message. Make the connection feel natural, not
  forced.
- Deliver the message with a concrete example. The example is what the
  audience will remember.

### The Pivot, Bridge, Flag Framework

For particularly challenging questions, use this three-step approach:

1. **Pivot.** Acknowledge the premise briefly: "I understand why that
   is a concern..."
2. **Bridge.** Redirect to your key message: "...and what my research
   adds to this conversation is..."
3. **Flag.** Provide the concrete evidence: "For example, in the
   communities I worked with, I found that..."

### Common Challenging Situations

**The oversimplification:**
"So basically, you are saying that [gross oversimplification]?"
Response: "It is a bit more nuanced than that. What I found is [your
actual finding, stated simply but accurately]."

**The policy prescription demand:**
"So what should the government do about this?"
Response (if you have a recommendation): "Based on what I found, one
important step would be [specific recommendation]."
Response (if you do not): "My research does not prescribe a specific
policy, but it does show that [finding]. Policymakers working on this
should consider [framing]."

**The "devil's advocate" question:**
"But couldn't you argue that [opposing view]?"
Response: "That is a reasonable objection, and here is what the evidence
shows..." Address it directly, do not evade.

**The personal question you are not comfortable with:**
"Have you personally experienced [topic of your research]?"
Response: "What I can share is what the people I worked with told
me..." Redirect to the research without appearing evasive.

**The hostile question:**
"Isn't this just [dismissive framing]?"
Response: Stay calm. Do not mirror hostility. "I understand that
perspective. What I found when I actually spent time with these
communities is..." Let your evidence do the work.

## Pre-Interview Checklist

### 48 Hours Before

- [ ] Research the outlet, interviewer, and audience
- [ ] Write out three key messages
- [ ] Craft one strong soundbite per key message
- [ ] Prepare an opening anecdote from your fieldwork
- [ ] List 5 questions you expect and prepare answers
- [ ] List 3 questions you dread and prepare bridge phrases
- [ ] Confirm logistics: time, platform, format, duration
- [ ] Test technology (microphone, headphones, video if applicable)

### Day of the Interview

- [ ] Review key messages (do not over-rehearse — you want to sound
  natural, not scripted)
- [ ] Have a glass of water nearby
- [ ] Close unnecessary browser tabs and silence phone notifications
- [ ] For video: check lighting, background, and camera angle
- [ ] For phone/audio: use a quiet room with minimal echo
- [ ] Have notes with key messages and one-word prompts visible
  (not a script to read)

### During the Interview

- [ ] Listen to the full question before answering
- [ ] Pause briefly before responding (sounds thoughtful, prevents
  stepping on the question)
- [ ] Return to your key messages naturally throughout the conversation
- [ ] If you say something you regret, correct it immediately: "Let me
  rephrase that..."
- [ ] If you do not know the answer, say so: "I don't have data on
  that, but what I can tell you is..."

## Post-Interview Strategies

### Fact-Checking Your Quotes

After a print or online interview is published:

- **Read it immediately.** Check for misquotations, inaccuracies, or
  misleading framing.
- **If you are misquoted:** Contact the journalist directly. Be
  specific about the error and provide the correct statement. Most
  journalists will correct factual errors.
- **If the framing is misleading:** This is harder to correct. If the
  article is technically accurate but misleadingly framed, consider
  whether a correction request is worth it. Sometimes a follow-up blog
  post or social media thread is more effective.

### Requesting Corrections

- Be polite and specific. "The article states X, but what I said was
  Y" is more effective than "your article is wrong."
- Act quickly. Corrections are easier to make in the first 24-48 hours.
- For audio/video: corrections are rarely possible after airing.
  Lessons learned apply to the next interview.

### Amplification

After a media appearance:

- Share the piece through your own channels (social media, email list,
  institutional newsletter).
- Tag the outlet and interviewer when sharing on social media.
- Send a thank-you note to the host or journalist.
- Share with your department and institution — media appearances matter
  for broader impacts and institutional visibility.

## Print vs. Broadcast Differences

| Feature | Print/Online | Podcast/Radio | Television |
|---------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Editing | Your words may be cut, rearranged, or paraphrased | Usually edited for length but your words remain | Heavily edited for time; soundbites only |
| Control | Limited — the journalist controls the narrative | Moderate — conversation format allows more space | Low — very short segments |
| Nuance | Moderate — space for complexity | High — long-form podcasts allow depth | Low — 2-3 minute segments maximum |
| Preparation | Provide quotes in writing if asked; request to review quotes | Practice out loud; prepare for conversational flow | Prepare visual aids; practice short answers |
| Correction | Can request corrections after publication | Difficult after airing | Very difficult after airing |
| Reach | Persistent and searchable | Growing audiences; episodes remain available | Large immediate audience; fades quickly |

## Social Media Amplification

### Using Social Media to Extend Scholarly Reach

Social media is not a replacement for media appearances — it is an
amplifier and an entry point.

**Strategies:**
- **Thread your findings.** A well-crafted thread (5-10 posts) can
  reach audiences that never listen to podcasts or read op-eds.
  Structure: hook → finding → evidence → implication → link.
- **Quote yourself.** Pull your best soundbites from interviews and
  share them as standalone posts. Add context if needed.
- **Engage, do not lecture.** Social media rewards conversation, not
  monologue. Respond to comments. Ask questions. Acknowledge good
  objections.
- **Know the platform.** Twitter/X rewards brevity and provocation.
  Instagram rewards visuals and personal stories. LinkedIn rewards
  professional framing. Choose the platform that matches your audience.

### Risks

- **Decontextualization.** Anything you post can be screenshot,
  shared, and taken out of context. Assume everything is public and
  permanent.
- **Pile-ons.** If your research touches a politically charged topic,
  social media engagement can generate hostile responses. Have a plan
  for when to engage and when to disengage.
- **Time sink.** Social media engagement takes time. Set boundaries.
  Scheduled posting tools can help.

## Common Traps

### The Overqualification Trap

Academic training rewards nuance and qualification. Media rewards
clarity and directness. The result: academics in interviews often
qualify every statement until it means nothing.

"Well, in the particular communities I studied, which of course may
not be representative, and bearing in mind that this is qualitative
data, it appears that there may be some evidence to suggest..."

The audience has stopped listening. Say the thing. Qualify briefly
if needed. Move on.

### The Jargon Trap

When nervous or when the question touches your area of deep expertise,
the temptation to reach for disciplinary vocabulary is powerful. The
audience does not know what "biopolitics" means and will not look it up.
Translate in real time.

### The "Well, Actually" Trap

The impulse to correct every oversimplification, every imprecise
framing, every "but that's not exactly how it works." Pick the
corrections that matter. Let the rest go. Being right about every
detail is less important than communicating the main finding clearly.

### The Excessive Caution Trap

Some scholars are so worried about oversimplifying that they refuse to
say anything definitive. "I can't really say" or "it's complicated" are
honest but useless as media responses. Find the claim you can make
confidently and make it. Acknowledge what you do not know briefly, then
return to what you do know.

### The Lecture Trap

An interview is a conversation, not a talk. If you are speaking for
more than 60 seconds without the host responding, you have shifted into
lecture mode. Break up your answers. Leave space for follow-up questions.
Answer the question that was asked, not the question you wish they had
asked.

### The False Equivalence Trap

Interviewers may try to create "balance" by presenting your findings
alongside a contradicting view. You are not obligated to treat all
positions as equally valid. "The evidence I have points clearly in
this direction" is a legitimate and necessary response when your
research supports a clear conclusion.
