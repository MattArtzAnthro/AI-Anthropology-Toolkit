## Return-of-Results Frameworks

Returning results is not an afterthought — it is a core ethical
obligation of research with communities. The question is not whether to
return results but how, when, and in what form.

### What to Share

Not all findings are appropriate for all audiences. Consider:

- **Findings the community asked about.** If the community had specific
  questions that motivated or shaped the research, these findings come
  first. The community's priorities take precedence over the
  researcher's academic interests.
- **Findings that affect the community.** Information that has practical
  implications — for health, policy, resources, rights — should be
  shared even if the community did not specifically ask for it.
- **Findings that are sensitive or potentially harmful.** Some findings
  may stigmatize a community, create internal conflict, or be used
  against the community by outside actors. These require careful
  consideration and community input before dissemination.
- **Findings that participants consented to share.** Consent forms
  specify what can be shared and with whom. Public reports and community
  presentations are different audiences than journal articles. Verify
  consent scope.

### When to Share

- **During the research.** Preliminary findings can be shared informally
  as they emerge. This builds trust, allows community input on
  interpretation, and catches misunderstandings early.
- **At the end of fieldwork.** A preliminary report or presentation
  before leaving the field site. This should not wait until the
  dissertation or article is published.
- **After analysis.** A formal report when findings are finalized.
  This is the primary return-of-results document.
- **After publication.** A plain-language summary of any academic
  publications. The community should not have to read a journal article
  to learn what the researcher concluded.

### How to Share

The format depends on the community, the relationship, and the content:

- **Community presentation.** Oral presentation to a community group,
  advisory board, or town hall. Interactive format allows questions,
  pushback, and community interpretation.
- **Written report.** A document the community can keep, reference, and
  share. Ranges from a one-page brief to a full report.
- **Visual formats.** Infographics, maps, photo exhibits, or video
  summaries. Especially useful when literacy levels vary or when
  the findings have strong visual components.
- **Community media.** Radio segments, newsletter articles, or social
  media posts in community-controlled outlets.

## Community Report Structures

### Full Community Report (10-30 pages)

A comprehensive return-of-results document designed to be accessible to
community members without academic training.

**Structure:**

1. **Cover page.** Project title in accessible language (not the
   dissertation title). Community partner logos. Date. Contact
   information for the researcher and community partner organization.

2. **Acknowledgments (1 page).** Thank the community. Name community
   partners, advisory board members, and organizations. Acknowledge
   participants (without identifying them if anonymity was promised).
   This is not a formality — it is a statement of relationship and
   accountability.

3. **Executive summary (1-2 pages).** The most important section for
   many readers. Write this last but place it first.
   - What was the project about? (2-3 sentences)
   - What did we find? (3-5 key findings in plain language)
   - What does this mean for the community? (2-3 implications)
   - What are the next steps? (2-3 concrete actions)
   - Write at an 8th-grade reading level. No jargon. Short sentences.

4. **Background (2-3 pages).** Why was this research done? What
   questions did the community and researchers want to answer? How was
   the research designed? Describe the partnership — who was involved
   and what roles did they play? Keep methods description brief and
   accessible: "We talked with 45 community members about their
   experiences with healthcare" rather than "We conducted 45
   semi-structured interviews using purposive sampling."

5. **Key findings (5-10 pages).** Organize by theme or by the questions
   the community wanted answered. For each finding:
   - State the finding in plain language (one sentence, bolded)
   - Explain what this means in concrete terms
   - Include supporting evidence — participant quotes (with consent),
     specific examples, numbers if relevant
   - Include community voice — how do community members interpret this
     finding? Do they agree? What would they add?

6. **What this means (2-3 pages).** Implications of the findings for the
   community. What does this information suggest about the problem or
   issue being studied? What opportunities does it reveal? What
   challenges does it confirm?

7. **Recommendations and next steps (2-3 pages).** Concrete,
   actionable items. These should be developed with the community
   advisory board, not unilaterally by the researcher.
   - What can community members do?
   - What can community organizations do?
   - What should policymakers do?
   - What further research is needed?

8. **Community response section (1-2 pages).** Space for the community
   advisory board or community leaders to respond to the findings in
   their own words. This is not the researcher's interpretation — it
   is the community's voice. This section should be written by
   community members, not the researcher.

9. **How to learn more.** Contact information, links to full
   publications (when available), information about upcoming community
   presentations or events.

### One-Page Community Brief

A single-page summary for wide distribution. Designed to be posted on
a bulletin board, handed out at a meeting, or shared on social media.

**Structure:**
- **Title:** Clear, plain language, states what the project found
- **Key finding in one sentence** (large font, prominent placement)
- **Three bullet points:** What we found, why it matters, what happens next
- **One quote from a community member** (with consent)
- **Visual element:** A chart, map, photo, or infographic
- **Contact information and QR code** linking to the full report

### Community Presentation Outline

For oral presentations to community groups, advisory boards, or
town halls.

**Structure:**
1. **Opening (5 minutes).** Thank the community. Restate the
   relationship — who you are, why you were there, what you promised.
2. **What we wanted to know (5 minutes).** The research questions in
   plain language. Remind the audience what they told you they wanted
   to learn.
3. **What we found (15-20 minutes).** Key findings, presented with
   stories and examples. Use visual aids. Keep it to 3-5 main findings.
4. **What this means (5-10 minutes).** Implications. Be concrete
   about what the findings suggest for the community.
5. **What we think should happen next (5 minutes).** Draft
   recommendations — framed as proposals for community input, not as
   expert pronouncements.
6. **Community discussion (20-30 minutes).** The most important part.
   Ask: Did we get this right? What did we miss? What do you want to
   add? What should we do with this information?

## Reciprocity and Co-Authorship

### Models of Reciprocity

Returning results is one form of reciprocity. Others include:

- **Co-authorship.** Community members or partners listed as co-authors
  on publications, including public-facing documents. This is
  appropriate when community members contributed to design,
  interpretation, or writing.
- **Capacity building.** Training community members in research skills,
  data analysis, or grant writing as part of the project.
- **Resource sharing.** Data, maps, reports, or tools produced by the
  research that the community can use independently.
- **Advocacy support.** Using research findings to support community
  advocacy goals — testimony, policy briefs, media engagement.
- **Financial reciprocity.** Participant compensation, community
  organization support, or shared grant funding.

### Co-Authorship Guidelines

When community members are co-authors on community reports:

- Discuss authorship early in the project, not after the report is
  drafted.
- Define roles clearly — who writes, who reviews, who approves, whose
  name appears and in what order.
- Community advisory board members may be listed collectively (e.g.,
  "with the X Community Advisory Board") or individually.
- The community has veto power over the public report. If the community
  does not approve the document, it should not be distributed.

## Consent Boundaries in Public Outputs

### Verifying Consent Scope

Before drafting any public document, verify:

- **What did participants consent to?** Read the consent forms. Did they
  consent to their words being shared in public reports? In media? On
  social media? Consent for academic publication does not automatically
  extend to public dissemination.
- **Are there additional restrictions?** Some participants may have
  consented to quotes being used but not to specific stories or
  identifying details. Honor the most restrictive interpretation.
- **Has the context changed?** If the political situation, community
  dynamics, or participant circumstances have changed since consent was
  given, consider whether the original consent still applies.
- **Can participants be re-contacted?** If consent is ambiguous, the
  best approach is to ask. Share the relevant sections with
  participants and get explicit approval.

### Strategies for Protecting Privacy in Public Documents

- **Composite cases.** Combine elements from multiple participants to
  illustrate a finding without identifying any individual. Label clearly
  as composites.
- **Generalized descriptions.** "Several community members described..."
  rather than attributing to specific individuals.
- **Community-level findings.** Present findings at the group level when
  individual stories are not safe to share.
- **Participant review.** Share drafts with participants and let them
  decide what they are comfortable having made public.

## Accessible Formatting

### Plain Language Principles

Plain language is not "simple" language — it is clear language that
respects the reader's time and does not require specialized training
to understand.

**Guidelines:**
- **Aim for an 8th-grade reading level** for general community
  audiences. This is not condescending — it is accessible. Major
  newspapers write at this level.
- **One idea per sentence.** Break complex ideas into multiple
  sentences rather than embedding them in subordinate clauses.
- **Active voice.** "The program helped 200 families" not "200 families
  were assisted by the program."
- **Define technical terms.** If a term must be used, define it
  immediately: "Food deserts — neighborhoods where it is hard to find
  fresh, affordable food."
- **Use concrete examples.** Abstract claims become accessible when
  illustrated: "Access to healthcare is unequal" becomes "Families in
  the east side of the city drive 45 minutes to reach a clinic; families
  on the west side have three clinics within walking distance."
- **Use headings and subheadings.** Break the document into scannable
  sections. Readers should be able to find what they need without
  reading the entire document.
- **Use bullet points and numbered lists** for key findings,
  recommendations, and action items.
- **Use visuals.** Charts, maps, infographics, and photos can communicate
  findings more effectively than text for many audiences.

### Visual Aid Guidelines

- **Charts and graphs.** Use simple formats — bar charts, pie charts,
  and simple line graphs. Label everything. Use large font. Include a
  one-sentence caption that states the finding the chart illustrates.
- **Maps.** Useful for geographically organized findings. Use clear
  legends. Consider privacy — do not map individual participant
  locations.
- **Infographics.** Combine text and visuals to communicate key
  findings. Useful for one-page briefs and social media sharing.
- **Photos.** With consent. Photos humanize a report and create
  emotional engagement. Include captions that explain the context.
- **Icons and symbols.** Use consistent visual language throughout the
  document. A health icon for health findings, a housing icon for
  housing findings, etc.

### Multilingual Considerations

If the community includes speakers of languages other than the language
the report is written in:

- Translate the executive summary and key findings at minimum.
- Use professional translation, not machine translation, for community
  documents.
- Consider bilingual formatting — key sections in both languages
  side by side.
- Consult community members about translation accuracy and cultural
  appropriateness.

## Cultural Considerations in Reporting Back

### Power Dynamics in Knowledge Return

Returning results is a power-laden act. Consider:

- **Who controls the narrative?** The researcher structures the report,
  chooses what to highlight, and frames the implications. Community
  review processes are essential to ensure the community's perspective
  shapes the final document.
- **Whose expertise is centered?** Academic analysis is one form of
  expertise. Community members have lived expertise that may lead to
  different interpretations. The report should include both.
- **What happens after the report?** A report that sits on a shelf
  serves no one. Discuss with community partners how the findings will
  be used and by whom.

### Community Review Processes

Before distributing any community-facing document:

1. **Share a draft with the community advisory board** (if one exists)
   or with key community partners.
2. **Allow adequate time for review.** At least two weeks for a full
   report, one week for a brief. More time if translation is needed.
3. **Be open to changes.** Community review is not a rubber stamp. Be
   prepared to revise findings, reframe implications, or remove sections
   the community considers inappropriate.
4. **Document disagreements.** If the researcher and community disagree
   about interpretation, note both perspectives in the report. Do not
   override community interpretation with academic authority.
5. **Get explicit approval** before distribution. The community should
   sign off on the final version.

## Format Templates

### Zines and Pamphlets

An alternative format for communities where formal reports feel
institutional or inaccessible:

- **Zine format.** A folded, photocopiable format (typically 8 pages
  from a single sheet). Combines text, images, and community art.
  Effective for youth-oriented projects or communities with strong
  artistic traditions.
- **Pamphlet/trifold.** Three-panel folded document. Front panel:
  title and key finding. Inside panels: findings and implications.
  Back panel: contact information and next steps.

### Digital Formats

- **Interactive web report.** A website or web page that presents
  findings with interactive elements — maps, charts, embedded video.
  Useful for wide distribution and accessibility.
- **Social media summary.** A series of posts (Twitter/X thread,
  Instagram carousel, Facebook post) that summarizes key findings.
  Useful for reaching younger community members and for amplification.
- **Video summary.** A 3-5 minute video presenting key findings.
  Can include participant voices (with consent), community footage,
  and researcher narration.

## Policy Brief Format

### Purpose

A policy brief communicates research findings to policymakers in a
format designed for decision-making. Policymakers are busy, read
selectively, and want to know what the problem is, what the evidence
shows, and what they should do about it.

### Structure (2-4 pages)

1. **Title.** Clear, specific, action-oriented. Not "An Ethnographic
   Study of Healthcare Access in Rural Communities" but "Closing the
   Healthcare Gap: What Rural Families Need from County Health Policy."

2. **Executive summary (3-5 bullet points).** The entire brief in
   miniature. A policymaker who reads nothing else should get the
   essential message from these bullets.

3. **The problem (half page).** What is the issue and why does it
   matter? Use local data if available. Make the problem concrete:
   "42% of families in the eastern district travel more than 30 minutes
   to reach a primary care provider."

4. **What the evidence shows (1-1.5 pages).** Key findings from the
   research. Present 3-5 findings, each with a clear heading. Use
   specific evidence — numbers, quotes, examples. Avoid academic
   hedging: say "the evidence shows" not "the data may suggest."

5. **Policy recommendations (half to one page).** Specific, actionable
   recommendations. For each recommendation:
   - What should be done
   - Who should do it (which agency, department, or body)
   - What it would cost (if known) or what resources it requires
   - What evidence supports this recommendation

6. **About this research.** One paragraph on who conducted the research,
   how, and where. Include contact information.

### Tone

- Formal but accessible. No jargon. Short sentences. Active voice.
- Evidence-focused. Claims backed by specific findings.
- Action-oriented. Every section points toward the recommendations.
- Concise. If it exceeds four pages, it is not a brief.

### Distribution

- Identify the specific policymakers, staffers, or agencies who should
  receive the brief.
- Consider timing — policy briefs are most effective when a relevant
  policy decision is upcoming.
- Follow up with a meeting request to discuss findings in person.
- Community partners may be effective co-presenters for policy audiences.
