# Fieldwork Methods & Data Collection

Design fieldwork data collection instruments, protocols, and processes for
qualitative and anthropological research. This skill treats fieldwork
instruments as both technical tools and relational practices: an interview guide
is simultaneously a cognitive scaffold for the researcher and a conversational
contract with the participant; an observation protocol is both a data capture
system and a disciplinary lens that shapes what is noticed and what is missed.
Good instruments balance structure with flexibility, providing enough scaffolding
to ensure rigor and comparability across contexts while leaving enough space for
the emergent, iterative, and relational dynamics that define ethnographic work.

Data collection design is inseparable from data management planning. Decisions
about how data will be recorded, stored, transcribed, de-identified, and
retained shape what can be collected and how it can be used. A beautifully
designed interview guide loses its value if recordings are lost to poor backup
practices, or if transcription choices strip context that the analysis depends
on. This skill therefore covers the full arc from instrument design through data
management, treating them as a single integrated system rather than separate
concerns.

The skill also addresses the human infrastructure of fieldwork: training
researchers to use instruments consistently without rigidly, building reflexivity
into data collection practice, and planning pilot tests that improve instruments
before the stakes are highest. Fieldwork quality depends as much on the
preparation and adaptability of the researcher as on the design of the
instruments themselves.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify What the User Needs

Determine the entry point:

- **Designing a complete research protocol from scratch.** The user has
  selected their methods and needs to build out the full data collection
  system: instruments, sampling, training, data management, and pilot testing.
  Load all three reference files and work through the complete protocol design
  process.
- **Writing an interview guide.** The user needs a semi-structured,
  unstructured, life history, or key informant interview guide for a specific
  study. Load the data-collection-methods-guide for interview design guidance.
- **Writing a focus group guide.** The user needs a moderation guide including
  ground rules, question flow, activity design, and composition
  recommendations. Load the data-collection-methods-guide for focus group
  design guidance.
- **Designing observation protocols.** The user needs a participant observation
  protocol, structured observation checklist, or field note system. Load the
  data-collection-methods-guide for observation design guidance.
- **Developing a sampling and recruitment strategy.** The user needs help
  selecting and justifying a sampling approach (purposive, snowball,
  theoretical, maximum variation, criterion, or other), determining sample
  size, and designing recruitment procedures. Load the protocol-design-guide
  for sampling strategy guidance.
- **Creating a data management plan.** The user needs a DMP covering storage,
  transcription, de-identification, backup, retention, and destruction. Load
  the data-management-guide for DMP structure and requirements.
- **Planning researcher training.** The user is managing a research team and
  needs a training plan covering instrument use, interview technique,
  observation skills, reflexivity practices, and quality assurance. Load the
  protocol-design-guide for training plan guidance.
- **Adapting instruments for a specific context.** The user has existing
  instruments that need adaptation for a new field site, population, language,
  or cultural context. Load the data-collection-methods-guide for adaptation
  principles plus the protocol-design-guide for pilot testing.

### Step 2: Gather Context

Before generating any content, collect these inputs:

**Required:**
1. **Research methods.** What data collection methods will be used? Interviews
   (semi-structured, unstructured, life history, key informant), focus groups,
   participant observation, structured observation, or a combination? Different
   methods require different instruments and protocols.
2. **Field site characteristics.** Where will fieldwork take place? Urban,
   rural, institutional, community, digital, multi-sited? Site characteristics
   shape instrument design, logistics, and data management requirements.
3. **Participant population.** Who are the participants? What are their
   demographic characteristics, power positions, vulnerabilities, languages,
   and literacy levels? Population characteristics affect question wording,
   interview format, observation focus, and sampling approach.
4. **Study duration and timeline.** How long is the fieldwork period? Is this
   a single intensive phase or multiple visits? Timeline shapes sampling
   targets, pilot testing feasibility, and data management volume.

**Important but can be inferred:**
5. **Sampling approach.** Purposive, snowball, theoretical, maximum variation,
   criterion, convenience, or other? If unspecified, recommend based on
   research questions, population characteristics, and epistemological stance.
6. **Recording plans.** Audio recording, video recording, handwritten notes,
   typed notes, photographs, or a combination? Recording decisions affect
   instrument design, consent requirements, and data management needs.
7. **Data storage infrastructure.** What tools and platforms are available?
   Institutional servers, encrypted cloud storage, local encrypted drives?
   Infrastructure affects data management plan design.
8. **Team composition.** Solo researcher or team? If a team, what is the
   experience level? Team size and experience affect training plan design
   and quality assurance protocols.

**Helpful but not required:**
- IRB status and any specific requirements or constraints from the review
  process
- Prior instruments from related studies that could serve as starting points
- Language and translation needs (multilingual fieldwork requires adapted
  instruments and transcription protocols)
- Community engagement history and existing relationships with field sites
- Epistemological stance (if not already established through the
  methodology-selection skill)
- Funder requirements for data management

### Step 3: Load Appropriate References

- **Load all three reference files** when the user needs a complete protocol
  design covering instruments, sampling, training, data management, and pilot
  testing. This is the default for protocol-from-scratch tasks.
- **Load** `references/data-collection-methods-guide.md` **alone** when the
  user needs help drafting a specific instrument: interview guide, focus group
  guide, observation protocol, or field note template. This is the default
  for instrument-drafting tasks.
- **Load** `references/protocol-design-guide.md` **alone** when the user needs
  help with sampling strategy, recruitment planning, researcher training, or
  pilot testing without also needing new instruments.
- **Load** `references/data-management-guide.md` **alone** when the user needs
  a standalone data management plan covering storage, transcription,
  de-identification, backup, and retention.
- **Load protocol-design-guide + data-collection-methods-guide** when the user
  needs instruments plus sampling and training but already has a data
  management plan.
- **Load data-collection-methods-guide + data-management-guide** when the user
  needs instruments plus a data management plan but does not need sampling or
  training guidance.

### Step 4: Generate Content

Follow the protocol design process, adapting the sequence to the user's entry
point:

1. **Define the data collection strategy.** Based on research questions and
   methods, specify what data will be collected, from whom, through what
   instruments, in what sequence, and over what timeline. Map each research
   question to the data collection activities that will address it.

2. **Design instruments.** Draft the specific instruments needed:
   - Interview guides: opening sequence, domain-based question modules,
     probe sets, closing and member-checking questions, adapted to interview
     type (semi-structured, unstructured, life history, key informant)
   - Focus group guides: ground rules, warm-up activities, core discussion
     questions, structured activities or ranking exercises, closing synthesis
   - Observation protocols: observation domains, spatial and temporal
     sampling strategies, behavioral categories (if structured), sensitizing
     concepts (if ethnographic), recording format
   - Field note templates: header metadata, running description format,
     analytic memo sections, reflexivity prompts

3. **Plan sampling and recruitment.** Select and justify the sampling
   strategy. Specify target sample size with rationale (information power,
   theoretical saturation, or other justification). Design recruitment
   procedures including access strategies, screening criteria, and
   contingency plans for recruitment challenges.

4. **Develop the training plan.** For team-based research, design a training
   protocol covering instrument familiarization, mock interviews or practice
   observations, inter-rater reliability procedures (if applicable),
   reflexivity exercises, and ongoing quality assurance mechanisms. For solo
   researchers, design a self-preparation plan with pilot exercises.

5. **Create the data management plan.** Specify data storage (encryption,
   access controls, location), transcription protocol (verbatim, edited,
   conventions, quality checks), de-identification procedures (pseudonyms,
   contextual detail management, deductive disclosure prevention), backup
   schedule and redundancy, retention period and destruction procedures.

6. **Design the pilot testing approach.** Plan cognitive pre-testing of
   instruments, pilot interviews or observation sessions, debrief procedures,
   revision criteria, and the timeline for incorporating pilot feedback
   before full data collection begins.

### Step 5: Generate Output

Produce one or more deliverables depending on user needs:

- **Interview guide.** Complete guide with opening sequence, domain-based
  question modules, probe sets, and closing. Formatted for use in the field
  with clear visual hierarchy and space for notes.
- **Focus group guide.** Moderation guide with ground rules, question flow,
  activities, timing estimates, and facilitation notes. Includes composition
  recommendations and logistics checklist.
- **Observation protocol.** Structured or semi-structured observation guide
  specifying what to observe, when, where, and how to record. Includes
  spatial and temporal sampling strategies where relevant.
- **Field note template.** Standardized template with header metadata,
  running description format, analytic memo sections, and reflexivity
  prompts. Adapted to the specific study context.
- **Sampling plan.** Strategy document specifying sampling approach,
  selection criteria, target sample size with justification, recruitment
  procedures, and contingency plans.
- **Recruitment strategy.** Detailed plan for identifying, contacting, and
  enrolling participants, including gatekeepers, access strategies, and
  scripts or materials.
- **Data management plan.** Complete DMP covering storage, transcription,
  de-identification, backup, retention, and destruction. Suitable for
  inclusion in an IRB application or funder report.
- **Training plan.** Researcher training protocol covering instrument use,
  interview and observation technique, reflexivity practices, and quality
  assurance procedures.
- **Pilot testing plan.** Pre-testing strategy specifying what will be
  piloted, with whom, how feedback will be collected, and what revision
  criteria will be used.
- **Complete research protocol.** Full protocol document integrating all of
  the above into a single coherent system. Includes a protocol summary,
  data collection matrix, and implementation timeline.
- **Adapted instruments.** Existing instruments revised for a new context,
  with documentation of what changed and why.

### Step 6: Quality Check

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] Instruments are clearly linked to research questions — every question
      or observation domain can be traced to a specific research question it
      helps answer
- [ ] Interview questions are open-ended and non-leading — no yes/no
      questions in the main guide, no embedded assumptions, no double-barreled
      questions
- [ ] Observation protocols balance structure with flexibility — enough
      categories to ensure systematic coverage, enough openness to capture the
      unexpected
- [ ] Focus group guides include ground rules, timing, and facilitation
      notes — not just a list of questions
- [ ] Sampling strategy is justified with a clear rationale — not just "we
      will interview 30 people" but why 30, why these people, and how they
      will be selected
- [ ] Data management plan covers the full lifecycle — from recording through
      storage, transcription, de-identification, backup, retention, and
      destruction
- [ ] Training plan addresses key competencies — instrument use, interview
      technique, reflexivity, and quality assurance, not just logistics
- [ ] Pilot testing is planned with specific procedures — what will be
      tested, with whom, how feedback will inform revisions
- [ ] Ethical considerations are embedded throughout — not siloed in a
      separate section but integrated into instrument design, sampling,
      training, and data management
- [ ] Instruments are culturally appropriate — language, format, and process
      reflect participants' norms, literacy levels, and communication styles
- [ ] Protocols specify flexibility and iteration points — where and how
      instruments can be adapted during fieldwork without compromising rigor
- [ ] Field note system includes reflexivity prompts — not just "what
      happened" but "what did I notice, what did I miss, how did my presence
      shape the interaction"

## Parameters

- **Output type:** Interview guide, focus group guide, observation protocol,
  field note template, sampling plan, recruitment strategy, data management
  plan, training plan, pilot testing plan, complete research protocol, adapted
  instruments. Determines scope and format of the deliverable.
- **Methods covered:** Semi-structured interviews, unstructured interviews,
  life history interviews, key informant interviews, focus groups, participant
  observation, structured observation, mixed. Different methods require
  different instrument structures and design principles.
- **Field context:** Urban, rural, institutional, community, digital,
  multi-sited, cross-cultural. Context shapes instrument adaptation,
  logistics, and data management requirements.
- **Population:** General adult population, youth, elders, professionals,
  marginalized communities, Indigenous communities, multilingual populations.
  Population characteristics affect question wording, interview format,
  observation focus, and sampling approach.
- **Document stage:** Initial draft, revision after pilot testing, adaptation
  for new context, revision after IRB feedback. Stage determines how much
  scaffolding to provide versus how much refinement to focus on.
- **Protocol scope:** Single instrument, multiple instruments, complete
  protocol with all components. Scope determines which reference files to load
  and how many deliverables to produce.

## Guardrails

- **Protocols must balance structure with flexibility.** Rigid protocols that
  script every moment of data collection are inappropriate for ethnographic
  work. But fully unstructured approaches risk missing critical data and
  undermine comparability. Help users find the right balance for their
  methods, questions, and field context. Interview guides should have clear
  domains and probes but leave room for follow-up; observation protocols
  should specify what to attend to but not constrain what can be noticed.
- **Interview questions must be open-ended, not leading.** Do not generate
  questions that embed the researcher's assumptions ("How has climate change
  affected your farming?") or that can be answered with yes/no ("Do you think
  the program was effective?"). Frame questions to invite the participant's
  own framing: "Tell me about changes you have noticed in your farming over
  the years" or "What has your experience with the program been like?"
- **Observation protocols are guides, not scripts.** Participant observation
  cannot be fully pre-specified because ethnographic attention must be
  responsive to what is happening. Observation protocols should sensitize the
  researcher to key domains and provide a recording format, not dictate a
  rigid sequence of behaviors to watch for.
- **Sampling must be justified, not arbitrary.** Every sampling decision
  needs a rationale grounded in the research questions and epistemological
  approach. "We will interview 30 people" is not a sampling strategy. Require
  a named sampling approach, clear selection criteria, a justified target
  number, and a contingency plan for recruitment challenges.
- **Data management is not optional.** Every protocol must include a data
  management component. Do not generate instruments without also addressing
  how the data they produce will be recorded, stored, transcribed, protected,
  and eventually retained or destroyed. Treat data management as integral to
  research quality, not as administrative overhead.
- **Instruments must be culturally adapted.** Do not generate generic
  instruments that ignore the cultural context of the field site and
  participant population. Question wording, interview format, observation
  focus, group composition, and data recording methods must all reflect the
  specific context. Flag when instruments need translation, visual
  adaptation, or procedural modification for the target population.
- **Pilot testing should be standard practice.** Encourage pilot testing for
  all instruments. Untested instruments risk wasting limited fieldwork time
  on questions that do not work, observation categories that miss the action,
  or recording procedures that fail in the field. Help users design realistic
  pilot testing plans even when time and access are constrained.
- **Route IRB and consent tasks to the correct skills.** When a user's
  request shifts from instrument design to IRB protocol writing or consent
  form drafting, redirect to the appropriate skill. This skill covers the
  data collection system; the irb-protocol and informed-consent skills cover
  the regulatory and ethical documentation that accompanies it.

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure mode | Prevention |
|---|---|
| Interview questions that are leading or closed-ended | Write open-ended questions that invite the participant's own framing; include probe sets for follow-up rather than embedding assumptions in the main questions |
| Observation protocols that are too rigid for ethnographic work | Design protocols that specify domains and recording formats but leave room for emergent attention; distinguish structured observation checklists from ethnographic observation guides |
| Sampling plan that is unjustified or arbitrary | Name the sampling approach, specify selection criteria, justify the target sample size using information power or theoretical saturation reasoning, and include contingency plans |
| No data management plan accompanying instruments | Require a data management component for every protocol; treat storage, transcription, de-identification, backup, and retention as inseparable from instrument design |
| Instruments not adapted to the field context or population | Review instruments against field site characteristics, participant literacy and language, cultural communication norms, and power dynamics; flag where adaptation is needed |
| No pilot testing plan before full data collection | Design a pilot testing protocol specifying what will be tested, with whom, how feedback will be collected, and what criteria will trigger instrument revision |
| Training plan absent for team-based research | Include a training component whenever multiple researchers will use the instruments; cover instrument familiarization, practice sessions, inter-rater alignment, and reflexivity |
| Field notes that lack structure or reflexivity | Provide field note templates with header metadata, running description sections, analytic memo space, and reflexivity prompts — not just blank pages |

## Examples

**Example 1: Complete interview guide for health research**

Input: "I need an interview guide for my study of community health workers'
experiences navigating between biomedical and traditional healing systems in
rural Guatemala. I'll be doing 25-30 semi-structured interviews in Spanish
and K'iche', audio-recorded. Participants are mostly women with varying
literacy levels."

Output approach:
- Load data-collection-methods-guide for interview design; load
  protocol-design-guide for sampling and pilot testing
- Design a semi-structured interview guide with four to five thematic domains:
  (a) professional trajectory and training, (b) daily practices and routines,
  (c) encounters between biomedical and traditional approaches, (d) community
  relationships and trust, (e) challenges and aspirations
- Each domain gets an opening grand-tour question, three to four specific
  probes, and follow-up prompts
- Opening sequence designed to establish rapport through narrative: "Tell me
  how you came to do this work"
- Questions worded to avoid biomedical framing bias; probe sets allow
  exploration of participant's own categories and frameworks
- Include bilingual considerations: key concepts that may not translate
  directly, space for K'iche' terms and participant explanations
- Add a sampling plan: purposive sampling stratified by community and
  experience level, with snowball recruitment through health center networks
- Design pilot testing: three pilot interviews across communities, debrief
  with local research assistant on question clarity and cultural
  appropriateness, revise before full data collection

**Example 2: Observation protocol for educational ethnography**

Input: "I'm studying how teachers in an urban middle school negotiate
standardized testing pressures with culturally responsive pedagogy. I'll be
doing participant observation in four classrooms over six months. I need an
observation protocol and field note system."

Output approach:
- Load data-collection-methods-guide for observation design and field note
  systems
- Design a semi-structured observation protocol with key domains:
  (a) instructional practices and curriculum choices, (b) teacher-student
  interactions and discourse patterns, (c) assessment-related activities and
  talk, (d) cultural responsiveness markers, (e) institutional context
  (announcements, testing schedules, administrative intrusions)
- Include spatial and temporal sampling strategy: observe each classroom at
  varied times across the week; rotate between focused observation sessions
  (single domain) and holistic sessions (full classroom ecology)
- Design a field note template: header (date, classroom, period, activity
  type, number of students), running description section (chronological
  narrative), thematic annotations (linked to observation domains), analytic
  memo section (emerging patterns and questions), reflexivity prompt ("How
  did my presence affect the classroom today? What did I attend to and what
  might I have missed?")
- Include guidance on positioning: where to sit, when to participate versus
  observe, how to handle students' questions about the researcher's role
- Design a pilot observation week: observe each classroom once using the
  protocol, assess whether domains capture the relevant action, revise before
  systematic data collection begins

**Example 3: Multi-method protocol for community-based research**

Input: "I'm designing a community-based participatory research project on food
sovereignty with three Indigenous communities in the Pacific Northwest. We'll
use interviews, focus groups, and participant observation. I need the full
protocol: instruments, sampling, training for community co-researchers, data
management, and pilot testing."

Output approach:
- Load all three reference files for complete protocol design
- Design three coordinated instruments:
  - Semi-structured interview guide for individual food sovereignty narratives
    (20-25 per community): land and resource access, food practices and
    knowledge transmission, institutional relationships, visions for food
    sovereignty
  - Focus group guide for community-level discussion (two per community,
    six to eight participants each): collective food history mapping exercise,
    current challenges and assets discussion, priority-setting activity,
    action planning
  - Participant observation protocol for food-related community events,
    gardens, markets, and gatherings: spatial and social organization,
    knowledge sharing practices, resource distribution, institutional
    interactions
- Sampling plan: purposive sampling within each community using maximum
  variation on age, gender, and role (elder, youth, food producer, community
  leader); recruitment through community advisory boards; target justified
  through information power framework
- Training plan for community co-researchers: instrument familiarization
  workshops, paired practice interviews with feedback, observation practice
  at community events, reflexivity discussions, ongoing peer debrief sessions
- Data management plan: community data sovereignty provisions (CARE
  principles), encrypted storage with community-controlled access, verbatim
  transcription with community review, de-identification protocols that
  protect individual identity while preserving community attribution where
  desired, backup to community-designated secure location, retention and
  destruction governed by community research agreement
- Pilot testing: pilot one interview and one focus group in each community,
  debrief with community advisory boards, revise instruments based on
  feedback before full data collection
