## 1. Interview Guide Design

### Types of Interviews

**Semi-Structured Interviews**

The most common interview format in cultural and social anthropology. A semi-structured interview uses a guide organized by question domains, each with prepared probes, while allowing the interviewer to follow the participant's lead. This format balances consistency across participants with the flexibility to explore emergent topics. It is appropriate for most stages of fieldwork after initial rapport has been established.

**Unstructured Interviews**

Conversational in form and guided by broad topics rather than predetermined questions. Unstructured interviews are most appropriate during early fieldwork when the researcher is still learning the local vocabulary, categories, and priorities. They support rapport building and exploratory inquiry. The researcher may have a mental list of topics but does not follow a written guide during the conversation.

**Life History and Narrative Interviews**

Organized around a chronological structure, these interviews invite the participant to narrate their life or a significant portion of it in their own terms. The interviewer provides open-ended prompts and intervenes minimally, allowing the participant to set the pace and determine what is significant. Life history interviews are used in oral history projects, migration studies, identity research, and studies of social change across generations.

**Key Informant Interviews**

Conducted with individuals who hold specialized knowledge, experience, or social position relevant to the research. Key informant interviews tend to be fewer in number but deeper in content, and they often recur across the fieldwork period as the researcher's understanding develops. Selection of key informants should be deliberate and documented, with attention to the limits of any single perspective.

**Structured Interviews**

Less common in anthropology but used in some applied and mixed-methods contexts. Structured interviews follow a fixed set of questions in a fixed order, with limited or no probing. They are useful when standardization across a large number of participants is required, such as in survey-style data collection that complements ethnographic work.

### Building an Interview Guide

#### Guide Structure

A well-designed interview guide follows a deliberate arc:

1. **Opening** (approximately 5 minutes): Establish rapport, review consent, confirm recording permission, set expectations.
2. **Warm-up questions** (approximately 5 minutes): Broad, easy-to-answer questions that orient the participant and build comfort.
3. **Core domains** (bulk of the interview): Organized thematically, moving from less sensitive to more sensitive material.
4. **Sensitive topics** (placed after rapport is established): Questions that touch on conflict, loss, power, health, or other areas requiring trust.
5. **Closing** (approximately 5 minutes): Participant reflection, invitation to add anything, explanation of next steps.

#### Question Design Principles

- Frame all questions as open-ended. Avoid yes/no formats.
- Do not lead the participant toward a particular answer.
- Address one concept per question. Compound questions confuse participants and produce ambiguous data.
- Use accessible, everyday language. Avoid jargon unless the participant uses it first.
- Match question length and complexity to the participant population.

#### Types of Questions

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Grand tour | Elicit a broad description of a setting, process, or experience | "Can you walk me through a typical day at the clinic?" |
| Mini-tour | Elicit a detailed description of a specific aspect | "You mentioned the morning meeting. Can you describe what happens there?" |
| Example | Request a concrete instance of a general statement | "Can you give me an example of a time that happened?" |
| Experience | Ask about a specific event or situation the participant lived through | "What was it like when the program first started in your village?" |
| Opinion | Elicit the participant's interpretation or evaluation | "What do you think about the way land disputes are handled here?" |
| Feeling | Ask about emotional responses | "How did you feel when you received that news?" |
| Knowledge | Ask what the participant knows about a topic | "What do people here generally know about the new policy?" |
| Temporal | Explore change over time | "How has this practice changed since you were young?" |
| Hypothetical | Explore reasoning or values through imagined scenarios | "If you could change one thing about the process, what would it be?" |

#### Probes and Follow-Ups

Probes are secondary prompts that deepen or clarify a participant's response. They should be noted in the guide but deployed flexibly during the interview.

**Types of probes:**

- **Elaboration**: "Can you tell me more about that?" / "What happened next?"
- **Clarification**: "What do you mean by [term]?" / "I want to make sure I understand..."
- **Contrast**: "How is that different from [related topic]?" / "Is that the same for everyone?"
- **Silence**: Pause for several seconds after the participant finishes. Often the most productive probe.

**Notation in the guide**: Indent probes beneath the main question and mark them with a dash or bullet. This signals to the interviewer that they are optional follow-ups, not required questions.

#### Sequencing

Use a funnel approach within each domain: begin with broad questions and narrow toward specifics. Place sensitive topics after the midpoint of the interview, when rapport is stronger. Always end on a neutral or empowering note, giving the participant the final word.

### Adaptation Guidance

**Adapting for different participant groups**: Revise vocabulary, question framing, and domain emphasis for each participant category. For example, questions about a health program would differ for health workers (process, challenges, resources) and patients (access, experience, outcomes). Create parallel versions of the guide and document the rationale for each adaptation.

**Translation and back-translation**: Translate the guide into the local language with a bilingual collaborator. Have a second translator back-translate into the original language without seeing the original. Compare the two versions and resolve discrepancies. Test the translated guide with a pilot participant before fieldwork begins.

**Visual and activity-based prompts**: For participants with low literacy or in contexts where verbal questioning feels extractive, consider incorporating visual prompts (photographs, diagrams, timelines drawn by the participant), object-based prompts (asking participants to show you something), or task-based prompts (asking participants to demonstrate a process). Document the prompt materials as part of the method.

**Digital and remote interviews**: When interviews must be conducted remotely (phone, video call), shorten the guide by approximately 20 percent, build in more frequent check-ins, and plan for technology failures. Obtain consent for recording through a process appropriate to the medium. Note that remote interviews limit access to non-verbal cues and environmental context.

---

## 2. Focus Group Guide Design

### Focus Group Fundamentals

**Purpose**: Focus groups are designed to explore group norms, shared meanings, and points of agreement or disagreement. They generate data about social interaction, collective reasoning, and the negotiation of meaning that individual interviews cannot capture.

**When to use focus groups**: Focus groups complement interviews; they do not substitute for them. Use focus groups when the research questions concern shared norms, collective experiences, or community-level perspectives. Use individual interviews when the research questions concern personal experience, sensitive topics, or individual variation.

**Composition**: Apply the homogeneity principle. Participants in a single group should share a relevant characteristic (age cohort, occupation, gender, community membership) so that they feel comfortable speaking openly. Typical group size is 6 to 10 participants. Plan for 3 to 6 groups per participant category to reach thematic saturation.

**Roles**: Every focus group requires at minimum a facilitator (moderator) who guides the discussion and an assistant (note-taker/observer) who documents the interaction dynamics, tracks who speaks, and manages logistics.

---

### Building a Focus Group Guide

#### Guide Structure

1. **Welcome and ground rules** (5 minutes)
2. **Ice breaker** (5 minutes)
3. **Opening question** (5 minutes): Simple, everyone answers, establishes participation norm
4. **Introductory question** (10 minutes): Introduces the topic broadly
5. **Transition questions** (10 minutes): Bridge from general topic to key questions
6. **Key questions** (20-30 minutes): Core research questions, 2 to 5 in number
7. **Ending questions** (10 minutes): Summary, missed topics, final thoughts
8. **Closing** (5 minutes): Thanks, next steps

#### Ground Rules Template

Read or paraphrase the following at the start of each group:

```
GROUND RULES

Thank you all for being here. Before we begin, I would like to go over
a few guidelines for our discussion.

1. Confidentiality: What is said in this room should stay in this room.
   I ask each of you to respect the privacy of other participants by not
   sharing what others say outside this group.

2. One voice at a time: Please allow each person to finish before
   responding. This also helps with the recording.

3. All perspectives are welcome: There are no right or wrong answers.
   I am interested in the range of views and experiences in this group.
   It is perfectly fine to disagree with one another.

4. My role: I am here to ask questions and keep the conversation on
   track. I am not an expert on this topic; you are. I may redirect the
   conversation if we move far from the topic, but I want to hear from
   all of you.

5. Participation: I encourage everyone to contribute, but no one is
   required to answer any question they are not comfortable with.

Does anyone have questions before we begin?
```

#### Question Types for Focus Groups

| Type | Purpose | Placement |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Opening | Simple, factual, everyone answers to establish participation | First question |
| Introductory | Broad connection to the topic, gets participants thinking | Early |
| Transition | Links the opening discussion to the key questions | Middle |
| Key | Address the core research questions; the most important questions | Middle to late |
| Ending | Summarize, identify missed topics, allow final reflection | Last |

#### Managing Group Dynamics

- **Dominant speakers**: Redirect with phrases such as "Thank you. I would like to hear from others on this." Use eye contact and body language to invite quieter participants.
- **Quiet participants**: Use the opening question (everyone answers) to normalize participation. Invite directly but gently: "[Name], what has your experience been?"
- **Conflict**: Acknowledge disagreement as valuable data: "It sounds like there are different views on this. That is helpful for me to understand."
- **Staying on topic**: Use transition phrases: "That is an interesting point. I want to come back to [topic] because I am curious about..."

#### Activity-Based Focus Groups

Incorporate structured activities to generate richer discussion and reduce reliance on verbal fluency alone:

- **Ranking exercises**: Provide cards with items (services, priorities, challenges) and ask the group to rank them collectively. Discuss the reasoning behind the ranking.
- **Participatory mapping**: Ask the group to draw a map of their community, marking relevant sites. Use the map as a basis for discussion.
- **Photo elicitation**: Present photographs related to the research topic and ask participants to respond.
- **Pile sorting**: Provide cards with concepts or terms and ask participants to sort them into categories they define. Discuss the categories.

---

### Logistical Planning

**Venue**: Select a private, comfortable, accessible space. Arrange seating in a circle or around a table so that all participants can see each other and the facilitator.

**Recording**: Use two recording devices placed at different positions around the group to capture all speakers clearly. Test the equipment in the venue before the session.

**Scheduling**: Plan for 60 to 90 minutes. Provide refreshments. Consider childcare, transportation, and timing relative to work schedules or agricultural calendars.

**Consent in group settings**: Obtain individual written consent forms before the session begins. At the start of the session, request a verbal confidentiality agreement from all participants using the ground rules. Note that confidentiality cannot be guaranteed in a group setting; inform participants of this limitation during consent.

---

## 3. Observation Protocol Design

### Types of Observation

**Participant Observation**

The hallmark of ethnographic fieldwork. The researcher participates in daily life, social events, and activities while simultaneously observing and recording. Participant observation is immersive and extended, typically spanning months or years. It is less structured and more responsive to the rhythms of the field site than other observation methods.

**Structured Observation**

Uses predetermined categories, checklists, or coding schemes to systematically record specific behaviors, interactions, or events. Structured observation is more common in applied anthropology, public health research, and mixed-methods studies where quantifiable observational data complement ethnographic description.

**Non-Participant Observation**

The researcher observes without participating in the activities being studied. This approach is appropriate when participation would alter the behavior being observed, when the researcher lacks the skills or social position to participate, or when the research context makes participation impossible or inappropriate.

**Focused Observation**

Targeted observation of specific events, interactions, settings, or processes identified through prior fieldwork. Focused observation typically occurs later in the research process, after broad descriptive observation has identified areas requiring closer attention.

---

### Designing Observation Frameworks

#### Dimensions of Observation

Drawing on Spradley's framework, systematic observation attends to the following dimensions:

1. **Physical setting**: Layout, objects, environmental conditions
2. **Actors**: Who is present, their roles, relationships, demographics
3. **Activities**: What people are doing, named activities and informal actions
4. **Interactions**: Who communicates with whom, about what, in what manner
5. **Timing and sequence**: When things happen, in what order, how long they take
6. **Goals**: What people are trying to accomplish (stated and apparent)
7. **Feelings**: Emotional expressions, atmosphere, tension, ease

#### Observation Schedule

Plan observation sessions deliberately:

- **When**: Vary times of day, days of the week, and seasons to capture the full range of activity.
- **Where**: Identify key sites and rotate among them.
- **How long**: Plan session duration in advance (typically 1 to 4 hours for focused observation).
- **How often**: Establish a regular rhythm, but remain responsive to unexpected events.

#### Balancing Breadth and Depth

Early fieldwork should emphasize broad, descriptive observation to understand the overall context. As the researcher identifies key processes, relationships, or events, observation becomes increasingly focused and selective. Document this progression in methodological notes.

- Documents or artifacts to collect:
```

---

### Structured Observation Tools

**Behavioral Checklists**

Define a set of behaviors or events in advance and record their occurrence during observation. Checklists typically include columns for behavior, frequency count, and notes. They are useful for tracking specific practices (e.g., handwashing steps, greeting rituals, meeting participation patterns).

**Time Sampling**

Observe at fixed intervals (e.g., every 15 minutes for 2 minutes) and record what is happening at each sampling point. Time sampling provides a systematic snapshot of activity patterns across a session or day.

**Event Sampling**

Record every occurrence of a predefined event (e.g., every time a patient enters the clinic, every time a dispute is raised in a meeting). Event sampling produces complete records of specific phenomena.

**Spatial Mapping**

Document where activities occur within a physical space. Create a sketch of the setting and annotate it with observations about movement, clustering, boundaries, and use of space over time.

**Appropriate Use in Anthropology**

Structured observation tools are most valuable when they complement rather than replace participant observation. Use them to systematize data collection on specific questions that emerge from broader ethnographic engagement. They should not be imposed before the researcher understands the local context well enough to define meaningful categories.

---

## 4. Field Note Systems

### Types of Field Notes

**Jottings**

Brief notes taken in the field, often in a small notebook or on a phone. Jottings capture keywords, phrases, timestamps, fragments of speech, and sensory details that will serve as memory anchors for writing full field notes later. Keep jottings discreet and unobtrusive when possible.

**Full Field Notes**

Expanded, detailed write-ups produced from jottings, ideally on the same day as the observation. Full field notes are the primary data record of ethnographic fieldwork. They should be written as if the reader was not present, providing enough detail to reconstruct the scene, interaction, or event.

**Analytical Memos**

Interpretive notes that connect observations to research questions, theoretical frameworks, and emerging themes. Memos are where analysis begins during fieldwork rather than after it. They should be dated and linked to the specific observations or interviews that prompted them.

**Methodological Notes**

Reflections on the research process itself: what worked and what did not, how access was negotiated, what the researcher would do differently, how the researcher's presence may have affected the situation. Methodological notes are essential for transparency and for writing up the methodology section of the final work.

**Personal Journal**

A space for the researcher's emotions, reactions, frustrations, and positionality reflections. The personal journal supports reflexivity and helps the researcher identify how their own identity, assumptions, and emotional state may be shaping what they observe, ask, and interpret.

---

### Field Note Protocols

#### When to Write

| Note Type | Timing |
|-----------|--------|
| Jottings | During observation, as soon as possible after notable moments |
| Full field notes | Same day as observation, ideally within a few hours |
| Analytical memos | Weekly at minimum, or whenever a significant pattern or question emerges |
| Methodological notes | After each data collection session |
| Personal journal | Daily or as needed |

#### What to Include

Every set of full field notes should contain:

- Date, time, and duration of the observation or event
- Location (specific enough to distinguish from other sites)
- Who was present (using pseudonyms or codes as appropriate)
- What happened, in chronological order (descriptive)
- What it might mean in relation to research questions (analytical)
- What the researcher should do next (methodological)

#### Separating Description from Interpretation

Maintain a clear distinction between what was observed and what the researcher thinks it means. Common conventions include:

- **Brackets**: Place analytical or interpretive comments in square brackets within the descriptive text. Example: "She looked at the floor while speaking [possible discomfort with the topic? Or cultural norm about eye contact?]"
- **Two-column format**: Description on the left, interpretation on the right.
- **Separate sections**: Write description first, then add analytical notes in a distinct section below.

Choose one convention and use it consistently throughout the project.

---

### Field Note Template

```
FIELD NOTES
Date: [date] | Time: [start time - end time] | Location: [specific place]
Activity/Event: [what was happening or what prompted this observation]
People Present: [who was there, using pseudonyms or codes]
Field Note Number: [sequential count]

DESCRIPTION
[Detailed, chronological account of what happened. Use thick description:
include sensory detail, direct speech in quotation marks, non-verbal
behavior, spatial relationships, material objects, and the sequence of
events. Write as if the reader was not present and needs to see, hear,
and feel the scene through your words.

Record what people actually said, as close to verbatim as possible, in
quotation marks. Paraphrased speech should not be in quotation marks.
Note who said what, to whom, and in what context.

Include what did NOT happen if the absence is significant (e.g., "No one
mentioned the new policy, even though it was posted on the wall").]

ANALYTICAL NOTES
[Connections to research questions. Emerging themes or patterns. Links to
previous observations or interviews. Theoretical ideas prompted by this
observation. Comparisons or contrasts with other data. Questions that
arise from this observation.

Label each note with the research question or theme it relates to for
easier retrieval during analysis.]

METHODOLOGICAL NOTES
[What worked well about this observation session. What was difficult or
limited (access, timing, researcher fatigue, disruptions). What to
observe next based on what was seen today. Who to talk to for follow-up.
Adjustments to the observation protocol or schedule.]

FOLLOW-UP
- Interview questions prompted by this observation:
- Additional observations to plan:
- Documents, photographs, or artifacts to collect:
```

---

### Practical Considerations

**Digital vs. Handwritten Notes**

Handwritten jottings are less obtrusive and do not require battery life. Digital notes (laptop, tablet) allow faster writing and easier organization. Many researchers use handwritten jottings in the field and type full field notes on a computer afterward. Choose the approach that best fits the field context; in some settings, pulling out a laptop is inappropriate while a small notebook is unremarkable.

**Organizing and Indexing Field Notes**

Establish a file naming convention at the start of fieldwork and maintain it consistently. A recommended format:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD]_[NoteType]_[BriefDescriptor]
Example: 2025-03-15_FN_MarketDayObservation
Example: 2025-03-15_AM_EmergingTheme_Reciprocity
Example: 2025-03-16_MN_AccessChallenges
```

Where FN = field note, AM = analytical memo, MN = methodological note.

Tag or code notes with relevant themes, research questions, and participant identifiers to support retrieval during analysis. If using qualitative data analysis software, import notes regularly rather than waiting until the end of fieldwork.

**Integration with Interview Data**

Cross-reference field notes and interview transcripts. When an observation raises a question, note it as a follow-up interview topic. When an interview reveals something unexpected, plan an observation to explore it further. Use consistent participant codes and site identifiers across all data types to facilitate triangulation during analysis.

---

## 5. Multi-Method Integration

### How Methods Complement Each Other

Each data collection method produces a distinct type of evidence:

| Method | Produces | Strengths | Limitations |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Participant observation | Behavioral and contextual data | Captures what people do in natural settings; reveals tacit knowledge | Limited access to private reasoning and motivation |
| Interviews | Narrative and reflective data | Accesses individual experience, meaning, and interpretation | Dependent on participant recall and self-presentation |
| Focus groups | Interactional and normative data | Reveals shared norms, collective reasoning, points of contention | Group dynamics may suppress minority views |

No single method produces a complete picture. Anthropological research designs combine methods so that the strengths of one offset the limitations of another.

### Designing Data Collection Sequences

The order in which methods are deployed affects the data they produce. Two common sequences:

**Observation first**: Begin with participant observation to learn the local context, vocabulary, and social dynamics. Use observational findings to design informed interview guides. This sequence reduces the risk of asking irrelevant or poorly framed interview questions.

**Interviews first**: Begin with interviews to identify key topics, perspectives, and contested areas. Use interview findings to determine what to observe and where. This sequence is appropriate when the researcher has limited time and needs to focus observation quickly.

In practice, most ethnographic projects iterate between observation and interviewing throughout the fieldwork period, with each method continuously informing the other.

### Triangulation

Triangulation in qualitative research refers to the use of multiple methods, sources, or perspectives to develop a fuller understanding of a phenomenon. Triangulation does not mean checking whether different data sources produce identical findings. It means examining how different types of evidence illuminate different dimensions of the research question.

Planning for triangulation:

- Identify in advance which research questions will be addressed by which methods.
- When findings from different methods diverge, treat the divergence as analytically productive rather than as a problem to resolve.
- Document the basis for each claim in the final analysis: which data sources support it, and how.

### Integrated Data Collection Matrix

Use a matrix to plan and track how each research question will be addressed across methods. This ensures that no question depends on a single data source and that data collection efforts are distributed effectively.

```
INTEGRATED DATA COLLECTION MATRIX

Research Question | Observation | Interviews | Focus Groups | Documents
------------------|-------------|------------|--------------|----------
RQ1: [question]   | [what to    | [which     | [which       | [which
                  |  observe,   |  questions |  questions   |  documents

                  |             |  cipants]  |              |
------------------|-------------|------------|--------------|----------
RQ2: [question]   |             |            |              |
------------------|-------------|------------|--------------|----------
RQ3: [question]   |             |            |              |
```

Complete this matrix during research design and revisit it periodically during fieldwork. It serves as both a planning tool and an audit trail, documenting how methodological decisions were made and ensuring that the research design remains coherent as fieldwork evolves.

---

## Summary of Key Principles

1. Design all data collection instruments before entering the field, but expect to revise them as fieldwork proceeds.
2. Pilot every instrument with at least one participant or observation session before formal data collection begins.
3. Separate description from interpretation in all written records.
4. Write field notes the same day as the observation or interview. Delayed notes lose critical detail.
5. Use consistent naming, coding, and filing systems from the first day of fieldwork.
6. Plan for triangulation at the design stage, not retrospectively during analysis.
7. Document all methodological decisions, adaptations, and rationales in methodological notes.
8. Treat every instrument as a living document that improves through use.
