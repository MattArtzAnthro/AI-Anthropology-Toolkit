# Assignment Design Guide for Anthropology Courses

## Purpose

This guide covers the design of assignments, rubrics, case studies, and assessment strategies for anthropology courses. Good assignments do not just test whether students did the reading. They create opportunities for students to practice the intellectual skills that anthropologists use: close observation, careful description, comparative analysis, theoretical reasoning, and ethical reflection. Every assignment should connect to at least one course learning objective and should be designed so that the process of completing it is itself a learning experience.

## Assignment Types for Anthropology

### Analytical Papers

**Description:** Students construct an argument about a specific question or problem, drawing on course readings and concepts. The most common assignment type in anthropology courses.

**Variations:**
- **Reading analysis:** Close analysis of one or two texts, focusing on argument, evidence, and method
- **Comparative essay:** Analysis of a concept, practice, or problem across two or more ethnographic cases
- **Theory application:** Apply a theoretical framework to a case study or current event
- **Critical response:** Engage with and critique an author's argument, offering an alternative interpretation

**Design considerations:**
- Specify whether students should use only course materials or conduct outside research
- Indicate expected engagement with theory vs. ethnographic evidence
- Provide a clear question or set of questions rather than a broad topic ("write about kinship")
- For introductory courses, provide more structure (specific texts to analyze, guiding questions)
- For advanced courses, allow more independence in framing the argument

### Ethnographic Exercises

**Description:** Students practice ethnographic skills through structured exercises that involve observation, description, and analysis of real-world settings or interactions.

**Types:**
- **Structured observation:** Observe a public space or event, produce detailed fieldnotes, and write an analytical reflection
- **Interview exercise:** Conduct a semi-structured interview (with appropriate permissions), transcribe a portion, and analyze themes
- **Autoethnography:** Systematically examine one's own cultural practices, assumptions, or experiences using anthropological concepts
- **Material culture analysis:** Document and analyze everyday objects, spaces, or technologies
- **Linguistic exercise:** Record and analyze naturally occurring conversation, code-switching, or language use in a specific context

**Design considerations:**
- Clarify ethical guidelines: public observation does not require IRB approval, but interviews may
- Provide fieldnote templates and examples
- Scaffold the exercise: practice observation before the graded assignment
- Be specific about what constitutes an acceptable site or topic
- Address how students should handle unexpected or ethically ambiguous situations

### Research Papers

**Description:** Students conduct independent research on a topic, synthesizing primary and secondary sources to construct an original argument.

**Design considerations:**
- Scaffold the process: proposal, annotated bibliography, outline, draft, final paper
- Specify acceptable source types and minimum number of sources
- Require a clear research question, not just a topic
- Distinguish between library research papers and papers based on original data collection
- For graduate students, frame the assignment as contributing to their developing research agenda

### Annotated Bibliographies

**Description:** Students compile and annotate a set of sources on a topic, demonstrating their ability to find, evaluate, and synthesize scholarly literature.

**Design considerations:**
- Specify the number of sources and acceptable source types
- Provide a model annotation showing the expected level of detail
- Require both summary and evaluation (what does the source argue? how does it relate to other sources? what are its strengths and limitations?)
- Connect the bibliography to a subsequent paper or project

### Reading Responses

**Description:** Regular, short written responses to assigned readings. Low-stakes writing that keeps students engaged with the material and prepared for discussion.

**Design considerations:**
- Keep them short (1 page, 250-500 words)
- Provide specific prompts rather than "respond to the reading" (identify the main argument, compare with last week's reading, apply a concept to an example)
- Grade on completion or with a simple rubric (satisfactory/needs revision) to keep workload manageable
- Use responses as discussion starters in class

### Presentations

**Description:** Students present research, analysis, or discussion leadership to the class.

**Types:**
- **Research presentations:** Present findings from a paper or project
- **Reading presentations:** Lead discussion of an assigned text
- **Group presentations:** Collaborative presentation on a topic or case study
- **Poster sessions:** Present research in poster format (useful for methods courses)

**Design considerations:**
- Provide clear guidelines on format, length, and expectations
- Include a rubric that addresses both content and presentation skills
- Build in Q&A time and peer feedback
- For discussion leadership, provide facilitation guidelines rather than expecting students to know how to lead discussion

### Exams

**Description:** Timed assessments that test knowledge, comprehension, and analytical ability.

**Types:**
- **Essay exams:** In-class or take-home essays responding to broad analytical questions
- **Short answer:** Brief responses testing comprehension of key concepts, terms, and arguments
- **Identification:** Identify and explain the significance of terms, figures, sites, or artifacts (common in archaeology and biological anthropology)
- **Practical exams:** Identify and analyze specimens, artifacts, or skeletal elements (lab-based courses)
- **Map-based:** Identify and discuss the significance of geographic locations (area studies, archaeology)

**Design considerations:**
- Provide study guides that indicate the format and scope
- For essay exams, give more questions than students must answer (choice reduces anxiety and rewards breadth of preparation)
- For take-home exams, be clear about collaboration and resource use policies
- Design questions that require analysis, not just recall

### Creative and Multimodal Projects

**Description:** Students demonstrate learning through non-traditional formats.

**Types:**
- **Podcasts or audio essays:** Narrative exploration of a topic for a public audience
- **Documentary or video:** Short films exploring a concept or community
- **Zines or graphic narratives:** Visual and textual exploration of course themes
- **Museum exhibits:** Design a virtual or physical exhibit with interpretive labels
- **Digital storytelling:** Multimedia narratives combining text, image, and audio
- **Teaching materials:** Students create lesson plans, discussion guides, or educational materials on a course topic

**Design considerations:**
- Provide technical support or resources for unfamiliar media
- Assess content and analysis, not production quality
- Require a written reflection or artist statement that connects the project to course concepts
- Offer creative projects as alternatives to traditional papers, not in addition to them

## Prompt Design: Writing Clear Assignment Instructions

### What Students Need to Know

Every assignment prompt should include:

1. **Purpose and learning objectives:** Why are students doing this assignment? What will they learn?
2. **Task description:** What exactly should students do? Break complex tasks into steps.
3. **Format and length:** How long should it be? What format (double-spaced, citation style, file type)?
4. **Evaluation criteria:** What makes a strong submission? Reference the rubric.
5. **Due date and submission method:** When is it due? Where do they submit it?
6. **Resources and support:** Where can students get help? Are there models or examples?

### Writing Effective Prompts

**Be specific about the task.** Not "write about kinship" but "Compare how two of the ethnographies we have read this semester represent kinship practices. What do the differences in representation tell us about the theoretical commitments of each author?"

**Specify the analytical move.** Tell students what kind of thinking you want: compare, analyze, evaluate, apply, design. The verb signals the expected level of cognitive engagement.

**Provide constraints that are productive.** A narrow prompt is not a limitation; it focuses analytical energy. "Using only the evidence from chapters 3 and 4 of the ethnography, analyze how the author demonstrates the relationship between economic precarity and social belonging" is more effective than "discuss the ethnography."

**Include models when possible.** Show students what a strong response looks like, especially for unfamiliar genres (fieldnotes, annotated bibliographies, ethnographic analysis). Annotated models that explain what makes them strong are particularly effective.

**Anticipate common mistakes.** If students typically summarize when you want analysis, say so: "This paper should be analytical, not summary. Summary describes what the author says; analysis explains how and why the argument works (or does not)."

## Rubric Design

### Analytic vs. Holistic Rubrics

**Analytic rubrics** break evaluation into distinct criteria (argument, evidence, analysis, writing), each assessed independently at multiple levels (excellent, proficient, developing, beginning). They provide detailed feedback and consistent grading.

**Holistic rubrics** describe the overall quality of work at each level without separating criteria. They are faster to use but provide less specific feedback.

**When to use each:**
- Use analytic rubrics for major assignments where detailed feedback matters
- Use holistic rubrics for low-stakes assignments (reading responses, participation) where speed matters
- Use analytic rubrics when TAs are grading to ensure consistency
- Use holistic rubrics for creative projects where criteria are harder to separate

### Rubric Criteria for Anthropology

**Argument and Thesis**
- Is there a clear, specific, arguable thesis?
- Does the argument go beyond summary to make an analytical claim?
- Is the argument appropriate in scope (not too broad, not too narrow)?

**Evidence and Ethnographic Engagement**
- Does the paper draw on specific evidence from course materials?
- Are ethnographic examples used analytically (not just as illustrations)?
- Is evidence cited properly and accurately?

**Analysis and Critical Thinking**
- Does the paper move beyond description to interpretation?
- Are connections drawn between cases, concepts, and/or theoretical frameworks?
- Does the analysis address complexity and avoid oversimplification?

**Engagement with Theory**
- Are theoretical concepts used accurately and productively?
- Does the paper demonstrate understanding of theoretical debates, not just definitions?
- Is theory applied to illuminate the evidence, not just dropped in?

**Writing Quality**
- Is the writing clear, organized, and grammatically correct?
- Are paragraphs focused and logically ordered?
- Does the paper follow the required format and citation style?

**Ethical Reflection (for ethnographic exercises)**
- Does the student demonstrate awareness of their positionality?
- Are ethical considerations addressed thoughtfully?
- Does the work show respect for the people and communities discussed?

### Sample Analytic Rubric: Ethnographic Observation Paper

| Criteria | Excellent (A) | Proficient (B) | Developing (C) | Beginning (D/F) |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Observation Quality** (25%) | Rich, detailed observations using multiple senses; notices patterns, anomalies, and context | Solid observations with good detail; attends to context | Basic observations; description is present but lacks depth or specificity | Minimal observation; vague or superficial description |
| **Fieldnote Craft** (20%) | Fieldnotes distinguish description from interpretation; well-organized; include timestamps and spatial orientation | Fieldnotes are organized and mostly distinguish observation from reflection | Fieldnotes present but lack clear organization or mix description with interpretation | Fieldnotes are incomplete, disorganized, or missing |
| **Analysis** (30%) | Analytical reflection moves significantly beyond description; connects observations to course concepts; identifies patterns and poses interpretive questions | Reflection connects observations to course concepts; some analytical depth | Reflection attempts analysis but remains mostly descriptive or makes only surface connections to concepts | Reflection is purely descriptive or does not engage course concepts |
| **Ethical Awareness** (10%) | Thoughtful discussion of positionality, observer effects, and ethical considerations of the exercise | Addresses ethical considerations adequately | Brief mention of ethics without depth | No ethical reflection |
| **Writing Quality** (15%) | Clear, well-organized prose; few errors; follows required format | Generally clear writing; some errors; follows format | Writing is understandable but has significant organizational or grammatical issues | Writing is unclear, disorganized, or does not follow format |

### Sample Holistic Rubric: Weekly Reading Response

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Complete (full credit) | Demonstrates engagement with the assigned reading; identifies a key argument, concept, or question; offers a substantive response that goes beyond summary; is submitted on time |
| Revise (half credit) | Submitted on time but is mostly summary, does not engage a specific argument, or is too brief to demonstrate engagement |
| Incomplete (no credit) | Not submitted, submitted late without arrangement, or does not demonstrate that the reading was done |

## Case Study Development

### What Makes a Good Teaching Case

A teaching case for anthropology presents a situation that requires students to apply concepts, make decisions, or analyze competing interpretations. Unlike a research case study, a teaching case is designed to generate discussion and learning, not to present findings.

**Effective teaching cases include:**
- A specific situation grounded in real or realistic ethnographic detail
- Enough complexity that reasonable people could disagree about interpretation or response
- A decision point or analytical puzzle that requires applying course concepts
- Sufficient context for informed discussion but not so much that the answer is obvious
- Connection to broader theoretical or methodological questions

### Types of Teaching Cases for Anthropology

**Ethical dilemma cases:** An anthropologist faces a situation where ethical principles conflict. Students must identify the competing obligations and argue for a course of action.
- Example: A researcher learns that an informant is engaging in illegal activity. What are the obligations to the informant, to the community, to the law, and to the research?

**Methodological choice cases:** A researcher must decide how to approach a fieldwork challenge. Students evaluate options and their consequences.
- Example: An anthropologist studying a religious community is invited to participate in a ceremony that conflicts with their personal beliefs. How does this affect the research?

**Analytical puzzle cases:** Students are presented with ethnographic data and must construct an interpretation.
- Example: Two ethnographers studying the same community reach different conclusions about gender roles. Students must evaluate the evidence and explain the divergence.

**Applied anthropology cases:** A practitioner must navigate competing stakeholder interests in a real-world project.
- Example: A cultural resource management firm discovers a significant archaeological site during a commercial development project. Students must consider the interests of developers, Indigenous communities, regulatory agencies, and the archaeological record.

### Writing a Teaching Case

1. **Establish the context:** Who, where, when, and what is the situation?
2. **Present the ethnographic detail:** Provide specific, concrete information (not abstractions)
3. **Introduce the complication:** What makes this situation difficult, ambiguous, or contested?
4. **Pose the question:** What must the reader decide, analyze, or evaluate?
5. **Provide discussion questions:** 3-5 questions that guide analysis from description through interpretation to evaluation
6. **Include a teaching note** (for the instructor): key learning objectives, possible discussion directions, common student responses and how to push beyond them

## Peer Review and Formative Assessment

### Structured Peer Review

Peer review is most effective when it is structured, specific, and practiced. Unstructured peer review ("read your partner's paper and give feedback") produces vague, unhelpful comments.

**Designing effective peer review:**

1. **Provide a review worksheet** with specific questions tied to the rubric criteria:
   - "What is the author's main argument? Write it in one sentence."
   - "What is the strongest piece of evidence in the paper? Why is it effective?"
   - "Where does the paper most need more analysis (as opposed to summary)?"
   - "Is there a place where a course concept could be applied more effectively?"

2. **Model the process:** Before the first peer review, model giving feedback using a sample paper (yours or a volunteer's from a previous semester, with permission). Show what helpful vs. unhelpful feedback looks like.

3. **Make it low-stakes first:** Practice peer review on a short, ungraded assignment before applying it to a major paper.

4. **Build in accountability:** Require students to submit their peer review comments alongside the final paper. Grade the quality of the review (not just completion).

5. **Use pairs or triads, not large groups.** Each student should give and receive focused attention.

### Draft-Feedback-Revision Cycles

For major assignments, build revision into the process:

1. **Proposal or outline** (graded on completion, with instructor feedback)
2. **First draft** (peer review using structured worksheet)
3. **Revised draft** (submitted for grading, with peer review comments attached)

This approach:
- Distributes the work across the semester rather than creating a single high-stakes deadline
- Catches problems early when they can be corrected
- Teaches students that writing is a process of revision, not a single draft
- Provides multiple forms of feedback (instructor, peer, self-assessment)

### Formative Assessment Strategies

Formative assessment happens during the learning process, not just at the end. It tells both the instructor and the student how learning is progressing.

**In-class formative assessment:**
- Minute papers and exit tickets
- Concept maps
- Muddiest point exercises
- Quick polls or show of hands
- Brief written responses to a question before discussion

**Out-of-class formative assessment:**
- Reading responses with instructor comments
- Practice exercises (fieldnote drafts, kinship diagrams, citation practice)
- Self-assessment reflections
- Online discussion posts with peer responses

## Scaffolded Assignment Sequences

### What Scaffolding Means

Scaffolding means breaking a complex task into smaller, sequential steps that build the skills students need. Instead of assigning a 15-page research paper at the end of the semester and hoping for the best, scaffold the process:

### Example Sequence: Building Toward an Analytical Paper

| Week | Assignment | Skill Developed | Connection |
|------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| 2 | Summary exercise: summarize a reading's main argument in one paragraph | Identifying arguments | Foundation for all analysis |
| 4 | Comparison exercise: compare two readings' approaches to the same concept | Comparative thinking | Building analytical muscle |
| 6 | Evidence exercise: select and analyze three key quotes from a reading | Using evidence | Preparing for evidence-based argument |
| 8 | Thesis workshop: draft and revise a thesis statement with peer feedback | Argument construction | Core skill for the final paper |
| 10 | Paper outline with annotated sources | Organization and research | Structuring the final paper |
| 12 | First draft submitted for peer review | Full draft writing | Revision practice |
| 14 | Final paper submitted | Integration of all skills | Culminating assessment |

### Example Sequence: Building Toward Ethnographic Research

| Week | Assignment | Skill Developed | Connection |
|------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| 2 | Describe a familiar object in 500 words without naming it | Detailed description | Foundation of ethnographic observation |
| 4 | Observe a public space for 20 minutes; produce structured fieldnotes | Observation and fieldnote writing | Core ethnographic method |
| 6 | Analyze your fieldnotes: what patterns do you see? What questions arise? | Moving from description to analysis | Analytical fieldwork skill |
| 8 | Draft an interview guide for a semi-structured interview | Interview design | Preparing for interview-based research |
| 10 | Conduct a practice interview with a classmate; transcribe 10 minutes | Interview technique and transcription | Hands-on practice |
| 12 | Combine observation and interview data in a short analytical essay | Data integration and writing | Ethnographic synthesis |
| 14 | Research proposal: design a feasible ethnographic project | Research design | Culminating assessment |

## Preventing Plagiarism Through Design

### Why Design Matters More Than Detection

Plagiarism detection software catches plagiarism after it happens. Good assignment design prevents it. Students plagiarize for many reasons: they do not understand the task, they run out of time, they feel overwhelmed, or they do not see the assignment as meaningful. Design can address all of these.

### Design Strategies

**Make assignments specific and unique.** A prompt that could be answered with a generic internet essay invites plagiarism. A prompt that requires engaging with specific course readings, applying specific course concepts, or analyzing a specific case does not.

**Scaffold the process.** When students submit proposals, outlines, and drafts, the final product has a visible development history. Plagiarism is harder to execute and easier to detect when you have seen the work evolve.

**Require specific evidence.** Require students to cite specific passages, use specific examples from class discussion, or analyze specific data. This makes the assignment harder to outsource.

**Discuss academic integrity as a disciplinary practice.** Help students understand that citation is not just a rule but a practice that situates their work within scholarly conversations. Frame it positively (joining a conversation) rather than punitively (avoiding punishment).

**Allow revision.** Students who know they can revise are less likely to panic and plagiarize. Build in second chances while maintaining expectations.

**Vary assignments across semesters.** Do not reuse the same prompts from previous offerings. Students circulate old papers, and assignment banks accumulate over time.

## Accommodations and Alternative Assessments

### Universal Design Principles

Design assignments to be accessible from the start, rather than making accommodations as exceptions:
- Offer multiple submission formats when possible (paper, audio, video, presentation)
- Provide detailed instructions and examples rather than relying on implicit knowledge
- Build in flexibility (a grace period, a dropped lowest score) that benefits everyone
- Allow extended time as a default feature of take-home assignments
- Provide assignment materials in accessible digital formats

### Common Accommodations

- Extended time on timed assessments
- Alternative testing location
- Note-taking assistance
- Flexible attendance policies
- Alternative format for readings (audio, large print)
- Modified assignment length or format
- Breaks during exams

### When Students Disclose Needs

- Thank the student for communicating with you
- Direct them to disability services if they have not registered
- Discuss accommodations privately and collaboratively
- Focus on what the student can do, not what they cannot
- Document agreed-upon accommodations
- Be flexible and willing to adjust if an accommodation is not working

---

## Exam Design

### Essay Exams

**In-class essay exams:**
- Provide 3-4 questions; students answer 2
- Questions should require synthesis across multiple readings and topics
- Allow a brief outline period before writing
- Assess argument and analytical thinking, not recall of specific details
- Grade with a rubric that values argument structure and conceptual accuracy

**Take-home essay exams:**
- Provide clear guidelines on collaboration, resources, and time expectations
- Design questions that benefit from reflection and revision (not just more time for the same task)
- Set a word limit to prevent over-writing
- Consider an honor code acknowledgment

### Short Answer Exams

- Write questions that test understanding, not just memorization
- "Define cultural relativism and explain why it matters for ethnographic research" is better than "Define cultural relativism"
- Specify expected length (2-3 sentences, a short paragraph)
- Provide a clear grading rubric or point breakdown

### Identification Sections

Common in archaeology and biological anthropology:
- Provide the item (term, image, artifact, specimen, site name)
- Ask students to identify it and explain its significance
- Require connection to broader course themes
- Grade for both accuracy of identification and quality of explanation

### Practical Exams

For lab-based courses in archaeology and biological anthropology:
- Set up stations with specimens, artifacts, or images
- Provide specific tasks at each station (identify, measure, classify, interpret)
- Allow sufficient time for each station
- Include some stations that require analytical thinking, not just identification
- Provide all necessary tools and reference materials
