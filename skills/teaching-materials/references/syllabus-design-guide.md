# Syllabus Design Guide for Anthropology Courses

## Purpose

This guide covers the design of complete course syllabi for anthropology courses at all levels. It follows backward design principles: start with learning objectives, design assessments that measure those objectives, then select readings and activities that prepare students to succeed.

A syllabus serves multiple functions simultaneously. It is a learning roadmap that tells students what they will learn and how. It is a contract that establishes mutual expectations. It is a planning document that structures the instructor's semester. And increasingly, it is a communication tool that signals the kind of learning environment students can expect. Good syllabus design attends to all of these functions.

## Backward Design Framework

### The Three Stages

**Stage 1: Identify desired results.** What should students know, understand, and be able to do by the end of the course? These become your learning objectives.

**Stage 2: Determine acceptable evidence.** How will you know students have achieved those results? These become your assessments.

**Stage 3: Plan learning experiences.** What activities, readings, and instruction will prepare students for those assessments? These become your course schedule, reading list, and lesson plans.

### Why This Order Matters

Most instructors design courses by starting with readings ("What do I want students to read?") or topics ("What should I cover?"). This leads to courses organized around content coverage rather than student learning. Backward design ensures that everything in the course connects to what students are supposed to learn and that you have evidence of whether they learned it.

### Applying Backward Design

1. Draft 4-6 learning objectives first
2. For each objective, identify at least one assessment that would demonstrate mastery
3. For each assessment, identify the skills and knowledge students need to succeed
4. Select readings and design activities that build those skills and knowledge
5. Sequence everything into a coherent schedule
6. Revisit objectives and assessments to check alignment

## Syllabus Structure and Required Components

### Course Information Block

- Course title and number
- Semester and year
- Meeting times and location
- Instructor name, office location, office hours, email
- TA information (if applicable)
- Course website or LMS location
- Prerequisites (if any)

### Course Description

Write 2-3 paragraphs that:
- Describe the intellectual focus and guiding questions of the course
- Situate the course within the discipline and subfield
- Explain what makes this course distinctive or why it matters
- Preview the kinds of work students will do
- Convey the instructor's enthusiasm and investment

Avoid catalog descriptions that read like encyclopedia entries. A course description should make a student want to take the course and give them a clear sense of what they are getting into.

### Learning Objectives

Write 4-6 specific, measurable objectives. Each objective should:
- Begin with a measurable verb (from Bloom's taxonomy)
- Specify what students will do, not what the course will cover
- Be assessable through at least one course assignment
- Be appropriate for the course level

**Bloom's Taxonomy Verbs for Anthropology**

| Level | Verbs | Anthropology Examples |
|-------|-------|----------------------|
| Remember | Define, identify, list, name, recall | Define key concepts such as culture, ethnocentrism, and cultural relativism |
| Understand | Describe, explain, summarize, compare, interpret | Explain how anthropologists use participant observation to generate knowledge |
| Apply | Apply, demonstrate, use, illustrate, solve | Apply concepts of kinship and social organization to analyze family structures across cultures |
| Analyze | Analyze, compare, contrast, examine, differentiate | Analyze how power relations shape ethnographic representation |
| Evaluate | Evaluate, assess, critique, justify, defend | Evaluate competing theoretical frameworks for explaining ritual behavior |
| Create | Design, construct, develop, propose, compose | Design a research proposal using ethnographic methods to investigate a contemporary social issue |

**Sample Objectives by Course Level**

*Introductory (100-level):*
- Identify the four subfields of anthropology and explain how each contributes to understanding human experience
- Describe the key methods anthropologists use, particularly participant observation and ethnographic writing
- Compare cultural practices across at least three societies to demonstrate the range of human social organization
- Apply the concept of cultural relativism to analyze a contemporary social issue

*Intermediate (200-300 level):*
- Analyze ethnographic texts as both data sources and rhetorical documents
- Compare at least two theoretical approaches to a central problem in the subfield
- Apply appropriate methods to collect and analyze primary data
- Construct an evidence-based argument that engages with anthropological theory

*Advanced undergraduate (300-400 level):*
- Evaluate the strengths and limitations of competing theoretical frameworks
- Design an original research project using appropriate methods
- Synthesize primary and secondary sources to construct an original argument
- Critically assess the ethical dimensions of anthropological research and representation

*Graduate seminar:*
- Historicize theoretical developments within the subfield, tracing intellectual genealogies and debates
- Evaluate primary sources and ethnographic data in relation to theoretical frameworks
- Develop an original research question and design a feasible methodology to investigate it
- Produce a publication-quality analytical essay that contributes to ongoing scholarly conversations

### Required Texts and Materials

- List all required books with full bibliographic information (author, title, edition, publisher, year, ISBN)
- Note which texts are available free online, on course reserve, or through the library
- List any required technology, software, or equipment
- Distinguish between required and recommended materials
- Consider cost and accessibility when selecting texts

### Grading and Assessment

Present the grade breakdown clearly, typically as a table:

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Participation | 15% | Active engagement in discussions, group work, and in-class activities |
| Reading responses | 15% | Weekly 1-page responses to assigned readings |
| Midterm exam | 20% | In-class essay exam covering Units 1-2 |
| Ethnographic exercise | 25% | Scaffolded observation and fieldnote project |
| Final paper | 25% | 8-10 page analytical essay |

Include:
- The grading scale (letter grades with percentage ranges)
- A brief description of each assessment component
- How each assessment connects to learning objectives (an alignment matrix is useful)
- Late work policy
- Policy on extra credit (if any)

**Assessment-Objective Alignment Matrix**

| Assessment | Objective 1 | Objective 2 | Objective 3 | Objective 4 |
|------------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| Reading responses | X | X | | |
| Midterm exam | X | X | X | |
| Ethnographic exercise | | X | X | X |
| Final paper | | | X | X |

Every objective should have at least one X. Every assessment should connect to at least one objective.

### Course Schedule

The schedule is the most labor-intensive part of the syllabus. It should include:

- Week number and dates
- Topic or theme for each session
- Required readings with specific page numbers
- Assignment due dates
- Exam dates
- Holidays and breaks

**Organizing Principles**

Organize by theme, not by reading. A thematic structure (4-5 units of 2-4 weeks each) works better than a week-by-week topic list because it:
- Creates coherent intellectual arcs
- Helps students see connections between readings
- Makes it easier to cut or reorganize if you fall behind
- Provides natural assessment points between units

**Sequencing Readings**

Within each unit:
- Start with accessible, engaging material that introduces the theme
- Move to more complex theoretical or methodological readings
- Include ethnographic case studies that illustrate concepts
- End with readings that complicate or synthesize
- Pair primary ethnographic sources with analytical commentary

Across the semester:
- Build complexity gradually (simpler concepts and methods early, more demanding later)
- Front-load foundational concepts that later units depend on
- Place major assignments after students have had time to practice the required skills
- Allow breathing room around midterms and major due dates

### Policies

**Attendance and Participation**
- State the attendance policy clearly (how many absences are permitted, what counts as excused)
- Define participation beyond just speaking in class
- Explain how participation is assessed (rubric, self-assessment, instructor observation)

**Academic Integrity**
- Include the institution's academic integrity policy or link to it
- Clarify what collaboration is permitted and what constitutes plagiarism
- State the policy on AI writing tools (permitted, restricted, or prohibited, and under what circumstances)
- Explain consequences for violations

**Accommodations**
- Include the institution's disability services statement
- Signal willingness to work with students: "If you have a documented disability or suspect you may have one, please contact [office] and speak with me so we can discuss accommodations"
- Build flexibility into the course design so accommodations feel like adjustments, not exceptions

**Late Work**
- State the policy clearly and consistently
- Consider a policy that balances accountability with flexibility (e.g., 48-hour grace period, a set number of penalty-free late days per semester, sliding penalty scale)

**Communication**
- State preferred contact method and expected response time
- Explain when to email vs. come to office hours
- Set boundaries around weekend and evening communication

**Content Warnings**
- If the course includes material depicting violence, trauma, sexual content, or other potentially distressing subjects, note this in the syllabus
- Explain how you will handle sensitive material in class
- Provide students with a way to communicate concerns privately

## Inclusive and Accessible Syllabus Practices

### Land Acknowledgment
If appropriate to the institutional context, include a land acknowledgment that is specific, substantive, and connected to course content rather than formulaic. For anthropology courses, connect the acknowledgment to disciplinary history and ongoing relationships between anthropology and Indigenous communities.

### Names and Pronouns
Include a statement inviting students to share their preferred name and pronouns. Model this by including your own pronouns in the course information block.

### Trigger Warnings and Sensitive Content
Anthropology courses frequently engage with difficult material: violence, colonialism, racism, death, sexuality, poverty, and trauma. Signal this in the syllabus and explain your approach. Options include:
- Noting specific sessions where difficult material will be covered
- Providing a general statement about the nature of the course content
- Offering students a way to discuss concerns privately
- Never requiring students to disclose personal experiences in class

### Multiple Assessment Modes
Design assessment so that students have more than one way to demonstrate learning. If the course includes a major paper, also include assessments that use other skills (presentations, creative projects, practical exercises, collaborative work). This is not about lowering standards; it is about recognizing that a single assessment mode advantages some students and disadvantages others.

### Accessibility
- Use accessible document formatting (headings, alt text, readable fonts)
- Ensure all digital materials are screen-reader compatible
- Caption all video content
- Provide materials in advance so students can prepare
- Offer alternatives for activities that assume specific physical abilities

### Reading Selection and Diverse Voices
- Include scholars from diverse backgrounds, not just canonical white male theorists
- Assign ethnographies from and about varied global contexts
- Include work by Indigenous scholars, scholars of color, and scholars from the Global South
- Balance classical texts with contemporary scholarship
- When assigning older texts with problematic framings, contextualize them critically

## Reading Load Guidelines

### Calculating Reading Load

Not all pages are equal. Adjust these baselines for difficulty:

| Text Type | Difficulty Multiplier | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| Accessible ethnography | 1x | Engaging narrative, clear prose |
| Textbook chapter | 1x | Designed for the level, includes summaries |
| Journal article | 1.5x | Dense argument, specialized vocabulary |
| Theory/philosophy | 2x | Abstract, requires rereading |
| Primary source (historical) | 1.5x | Unfamiliar language and context |
| Visual/multimedia | 0.5x | Films, podcasts, virtual exhibits (by time equivalent) |

### Weekly Targets by Level

- **Introductory:** 30-50 pages/week (approximately 2-3 hours of reading)
- **Intermediate:** 40-60 pages/week (approximately 3-4 hours)
- **Advanced undergraduate:** 60-100 pages/week (approximately 4-6 hours)
- **Graduate:** 80-150 pages/week (approximately 6-10 hours)

### Common Mistakes

- Assigning the same volume every week without accounting for major assignment due dates
- Front-loading heavy readings before students have developed reading strategies for the discipline
- Assigning full monographs without guidance on what to focus on
- Not accounting for the cumulative reading load across students' full course loads

## The Syllabus as a Living Document

A syllabus is a plan, not a prison. Build in flexibility:

- Include a statement that the schedule is subject to revision
- Identify readings that could be cut if you fall behind
- Design units that could be shortened without losing coherence
- Leave one or two sessions unscheduled as buffer
- Plan "catch-up" or "deep dive" sessions at natural transition points

At the same time, respect the contractual function of the syllabus. Major changes to grading, assessment, or course requirements should be communicated clearly, explained, and ideally agreed upon with students.

---

## Online and Hybrid Adaptations

### Asynchronous Components
- Record short lecture segments (10-15 minutes maximum)
- Create structured discussion boards with clear prompts and response expectations
- Design self-paced activities with deadlines
- Use collaborative documents for group work
- Provide detailed written instructions for every activity

### Synchronous Online Sessions
- Shorten sessions compared to in-person (screen fatigue is real)
- Use breakout rooms for small group discussion
- Build in movement breaks and varied activities
- Have a backup plan for technology failures
- Record sessions for students who cannot attend synchronously

### Hybrid Design
- Ensure equitable experience for in-person and online students
- Avoid designing two separate courses that happen to share a name
- Use technology that allows real participation from both groups
- Rotate which activities happen in person vs. online
- Be explicit about which components are synchronous, asynchronous, in-person, and online

## Subfield-Specific Considerations

### Cultural Anthropology
- Central challenge: balancing breadth of topics with depth of engagement
- Consider organizing around questions rather than topics (not "kinship" but "how do people create families?")
- Ethnographic case studies are the core material; theory should emerge from cases

### Archaeology
- Lab and field components require separate scheduling and safety protocols
- Material culture analysis exercises need physical or digital collections
- Methods and theory are tightly integrated; avoid separating them into different course sections

### Biological Anthropology
- Lab sections for osteology, primatology, or genetics require equipment and specimens
- Balancing evolutionary frameworks with cultural sensitivity around human variation
- Integrating current research on topics where public understanding lags (race as biology, human evolution)

### Linguistic Anthropology
- Transcription and analysis exercises require audio/video materials
- Students need practice with technical notation systems (IPA, discourse transcription)
- Connecting language analysis to broader social and cultural questions

### Medical Anthropology
- Clinical and community-based examples raise specific ethical considerations
- Balancing biomedical and critical/interpretive frameworks
- Sensitivity around students' personal health experiences

### Applied Anthropology
- Community engagement and partnership logistics require advance planning
- Ethical obligations to community partners extend beyond the semester
- Professional development components (consulting, evaluation, design research) supplement academic content
