# Lesson Planning Guide for Anthropology Courses

## Purpose

This guide covers the design of individual class sessions and lesson sequences for anthropology courses. A good lesson plan is not a script. It is a structure that keeps the session purposeful, paced, and responsive to what students actually need. Every session should have a clear goal (what students will be able to do by the end), a logical flow (how activities build toward that goal), and enough flexibility to adapt when things go differently than planned.

---

## Lesson Plan Structure

### The Three-Part Framework

Every class session, regardless of length or format, benefits from three phases:

**Opening / Hook (5-15 minutes)**
- Activates prior knowledge or connects to previous sessions
- Creates a question or puzzle that frames the session
- Gets students thinking and engaged before the main content
- Establishes what the session is about and why it matters

**Main Activities (30-60 minutes, depending on session length)**
- The core learning work of the session
- May include lecture segments, discussion, group work, exercises, or a combination
- Should involve students doing something, not just listening
- Typically includes 2-3 distinct activities rather than one long block

**Closure / Synthesis (5-15 minutes)**
- Returns to the opening question or frame
- Asks students to articulate what they learned or what questions remain
- Previews the next session and connects forward
- May include a brief assessment (exit ticket, minute paper)

### Time Allocation by Session Length

| Session Length | Opening | Main Activities | Closure |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|---------|
| 50 minutes (MWF) | 5-8 min | 30-35 min | 5-8 min |
| 75 minutes (TTh) | 8-12 min | 45-55 min | 8-12 min |
| 150 minutes (weekly seminar) | 10-15 min | 110-120 min (with break) | 15-20 min |
| 180 minutes (graduate seminar) | 10-15 min | 135-145 min (with break) | 15-20 min |

For sessions longer than 75 minutes, build in a 10-minute break roughly halfway through. Students (and instructors) lose focus without breaks.

## Opening / Hook Strategies

### Question-Based Openings
Pose a question that connects to the day's topic and ask students to spend 2-3 minutes writing a response before any discussion. This activates thinking, gives everyone a chance to formulate ideas, and creates material students can draw on during later discussion.

**Examples:**
- "Before we discuss reciprocity, write about a time you felt obligated to give a gift. What made you feel obligated? Was it a good feeling or an uncomfortable one?"
- "Based on last week's reading about fieldwork ethics, what do you think is the most difficult ethical challenge an anthropologist faces? Why?"
- "Look at this photograph. What can you tell about the people, place, and context? What assumptions are you making?"

### Connection to Previous Session
Briefly recap where the class left off and frame how today builds on it. Ask students to recall one key concept or question from the last session. This is especially important in MWF courses where sessions are short and topics can feel fragmented.

### Provocative Statement or Puzzle
Present a claim, statistic, or scenario that challenges assumptions and sets up the intellectual work of the session.

**Examples:**
- "An anthropologist argued that there is no such thing as human nature. What would it take to convince you that's true?"
- "In 2024, the global refugee population exceeded 120 million people. What does anthropology offer that other disciplines don't in understanding forced migration?"
- "A colleague told me that ethnography is just glorified journalism. How would you respond?"

### Object, Image, or Artifact
Show a physical object, image, map, or artifact and ask students to observe and interpret. This works especially well in archaeology, biological anthropology, and material culture courses, but can be adapted for any subfield.

## Discussion Facilitation Techniques

### Think-Pair-Share
**Structure:** Individual reflection (2-3 min) followed by partner discussion (3-5 min) followed by whole-class sharing (5-10 min).
**Best for:** Getting all students to engage, not just frequent speakers. Particularly effective in large classes or when discussing sensitive topics.
**Tips:** Give a specific question or prompt. Circulate during the pair phase to listen for interesting ideas to bring to the whole group.

### Fishbowl Discussion
**Structure:** A small group (4-6 students) discusses in the center while the rest of the class observes. Observers have specific tasks (tracking arguments, noting evidence, identifying assumptions). After 15-20 minutes, rotate new students into the center or open to the whole class.
**Best for:** Modeling close discussion, giving students a chance to practice sustained argument, and creating accountability for preparation.
**Tips:** Provide clear guidelines for both inner and outer circles. Give observers a structured worksheet.

### Socratic Seminar
**Structure:** Students come prepared with questions and textual evidence. The instructor facilitates by asking follow-up questions rather than providing answers. The goal is sustained, student-driven exploration of a text or problem.
**Best for:** Advanced undergraduates and graduate students who have done the reading closely. Works well with dense or ambiguous texts.
**Tips:** Set ground rules (speak to each other, not just to the instructor; cite the text; build on what others say). Resist the urge to answer questions or resolve ambiguity too quickly.

### Jigsaw
**Structure:** Each student or small group becomes expert on one piece of a larger puzzle (a section of a reading, a case study, a theoretical perspective). Groups then reorganize so that each new group contains one expert on each piece. Experts teach their piece to the new group, and the group synthesizes the whole.
**Best for:** Covering more material than discussion allows, building teaching skills, and creating interdependence.
**Tips:** Provide clear instructions for both the expert phase and the teaching phase. Give groups a synthesis task that requires all pieces.

### Structured Debate
**Structure:** Assign students to positions (for and against a proposition, or representing different theoretical perspectives). Allow preparation time, then run a structured debate with opening statements, rebuttals, and questions from the audience. Debrief afterward to distinguish role-playing from personal positions.
**Best for:** Exploring contested issues, practicing argumentation, and forcing charitable engagement with opposing views.
**Tips:** Assign positions rather than letting students choose (this prevents debates from becoming referendums on personal opinion). Always debrief: what was convincing? What evidence was missing?

### Small Group Discussion with Report-Back
**Structure:** Divide into groups of 3-5, give each group a specific question or task (not the same question for every group), allow 10-15 minutes for discussion, then have each group report their key findings to the class.
**Best for:** Medium to large classes where whole-class discussion is difficult. Works well when you want to cover multiple angles on a topic simultaneously.
**Tips:** Assign roles (facilitator, notetaker, reporter). Give groups different but related questions. Keep report-backs brief (2-3 minutes each) and facilitate connections between groups.

## Active Learning Strategies for Anthropology

### Artifact Analysis
**Activity:** Present students with an object (physical or photographed) and ask them to analyze it systematically: material, manufacture, use wear, context, function, meaning. Move from physical description to cultural interpretation.
**Subfields:** Archaeology, cultural anthropology, biological anthropology (skeletal or fossil analysis)
**Time:** 15-30 minutes
**Adaptation for large classes:** Use images projected on screen; students work in pairs and write responses on worksheets.

### Kinship Diagramming
**Activity:** Students diagram their own kinship system using standard anthropological notation, then compare with a partner. Discuss the assumptions embedded in different kinship terminologies and why their own system seems "natural."
**Subfields:** Cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology
**Time:** 20-30 minutes
**Note:** Be sensitive to students with complicated family situations. Offer the option of diagramming a fictional family or a family from an ethnography.

### Fieldnote Writing Exercise
**Activity:** Students conduct a brief observation exercise (10-15 minutes observing a campus space, a video clip, or a classroom interaction) and produce structured fieldnotes. Compare fieldnotes in pairs or small groups to discuss what different observers noticed and why.
**Subfields:** All (methods training)
**Time:** 30-45 minutes (including observation, writing, and comparison)
**Scaffolding:** Provide a fieldnote template with sections for physical description, activities, dialogue, and observer reflections.

### Mapping Exercises
**Activity:** Students create maps of a space (campus, neighborhood, classroom) from different perspectives or with different goals (wayfinding, social use, power relations, accessibility). Compare maps to discuss how perspective shapes representation.
**Subfields:** Cultural anthropology, archaeology, applied anthropology
**Time:** 20-40 minutes

### Mini-Ethnography
**Activity:** A short, structured ethnographic exercise conducted outside of class (observe a public ritual, document a food practice, analyze a commercial space). Students bring findings back to class for discussion and analysis.
**Subfields:** Cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology, applied anthropology
**Time:** Outside class for data collection (1-2 hours); in-class discussion (20-30 minutes)
**Ethics:** Limit to public observation; no interviews without IRB approval.

### Photo Elicitation
**Activity:** Students bring or are shown photographs related to a course topic. Use the images as springboards for discussion about representation, perspective, and the relationship between visual evidence and interpretation.
**Subfields:** Cultural anthropology, visual anthropology, archaeology
**Time:** 20-30 minutes

### Simulation and Role-Play
**Activity:** Students take on roles in a structured scenario that illustrates a concept (a market exchange simulation for economic anthropology, a kinship naming exercise, an archaeological site triage scenario).
**Subfields:** All, adapted to content
**Time:** 30-60 minutes (including debrief)
**Caution:** Never ask students to role-play oppression, trauma, or marginalized identities. Simulations should model systems and processes, not experiences of suffering.

### Close Reading Exercise
**Activity:** Select a short passage (1-2 paragraphs) from the assigned reading. Project or distribute it. Students annotate it individually, then discuss in small groups: What is the author arguing? What evidence supports it? What assumptions are present? What terms need unpacking?
**Subfields:** All
**Time:** 15-25 minutes
**Best for:** Teaching students how to read academic texts closely, especially early in the semester.

### Concept Mapping
**Activity:** Students create visual maps showing relationships between key concepts from a unit or reading. Can be done individually, in pairs, or as a whole-class activity on the board.
**Subfields:** All
**Time:** 15-25 minutes

## Managing Discussion Across Class Sizes

### Small Seminar (Under 20 Students)

**Advantages:** Every student can speak; the instructor can track individual participation; discussion can be sustained and deep.

**Challenges:** Quiet students may feel exposed; dominant voices can take over; awkward silences feel more intense.

**Strategies:**
- Use think-pair-share before opening to the full group
- Set norms early: everyone speaks at least once before anyone speaks a third time
- Use round-robins for low-stakes contributions (each person shares one observation)
- Address quiet students privately and offer alternatives (written contributions, leading a session)
- Sit in a circle or around a table rather than in rows

### Medium Class (20-50 Students)

**Advantages:** Enough students for diverse perspectives; small group work is effective; some anonymity reduces pressure.

**Challenges:** Whole-class discussion is harder to manage; not everyone can speak in a given session; it is easy to default to lecture.

**Strategies:**
- Alternate between small group discussion and whole-class sharing
- Use structured activities (jigsaw, fishbowl) rather than open discussion
- Incorporate written responses that feed into discussion
- Move around the room rather than staying at the front
- Use technology (polling, shared documents) to collect responses from everyone

### Large Lecture (50+ Students)

**Advantages:** Exposure to many perspectives; anonymity can encourage risk-taking through written or anonymous responses; lecture can be efficient for content delivery.

**Challenges:** True discussion is difficult; students feel anonymous; it is easy to become passive.

**Strategies:**
- Build in 2-3 active learning moments per session (think-pair-share, polling, brief writing)
- Use clickers or polling software for real-time response
- Break into pairs or trios for brief discussions (even in fixed seating)
- Collect written responses (minute papers, exit tickets) as a form of participation
- Discussion sections led by TAs should connect to lecture content with specific activities

## Time Management and Pacing

### Planning Time Realistically

Every activity takes longer than you think. Build in buffer time and plan what you will cut if you run short.

| Activity | Planned Time | Realistic Time | Notes |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Administrative announcements | 2 min | 5-8 min | Especially early in semester |
| Transition between activities | 0 min (not planned) | 2-3 min each | Moving into groups, distributing materials |
| Small group discussion | 10 min | 12-15 min | Groups need time to warm up |
| Student presentations | 5 min each | 7-8 min each | Questions and transitions add up |
| Technology setup | 0 min | 3-5 min | Videos, screen sharing, polling |

### What to Cut When You Run Short
Prioritize student activity over instructor talk. If time is short:
1. Cut lecture content (students can read it)
2. Shorten the opening (but do not skip it)
3. Do not cut the closure (even a 2-minute synthesis is better than none)
4. If an activity is going well and productive, let it run and adjust the next session

## Handling Difficult Moments

### Sensitive Topics
Anthropology regularly engages with topics that provoke strong emotions: racism, colonialism, gender-based violence, poverty, death, and cultural practices that challenge students' values.

**Preparation:**
- Flag sensitive content in advance (in the syllabus and at the start of the session)
- Establish discussion norms early in the semester (respectful disagreement, speaking from evidence, distinguishing between critiquing ideas and attacking people)
- Prepare specific questions that guide discussion productively
- Have a plan for if a student becomes distressed

**During class:**
- Acknowledge the difficulty of the material directly
- Redirect personal disclosures toward analytical frameworks ("Thank you for sharing that. How does your experience connect to what the author is arguing about structural violence?")
- Do not force students to share personal experiences
- If discussion becomes heated, pause and ask everyone to write for 2 minutes before continuing

### Student Disagreement
Productive disagreement is valuable; personal attacks are not.

**Strategies:**
- Redirect to evidence: "What from the reading supports your position?"
- Name the disagreement: "It sounds like you two are working from different definitions of culture. Let's unpack that."
- Validate both positions while pushing for analytical rigor
- Distinguish between empirical claims (what is the evidence?) and normative claims (what should we value?)

### Emotional Responses to Ethnographic Material
Students sometimes have strong emotional reactions to ethnographic descriptions of suffering, injustice, or culturally unfamiliar practices.

**Strategies:**
- Normalize emotional responses: "It is appropriate to feel something when reading about this."
- Channel emotion toward analysis: "What structures produce the conditions this ethnography describes?"
- Resist the impulse to resolve discomfort quickly; some discomfort is productive
- Follow up individually with students who seem particularly affected

---

## Incorporating Multimedia

### Film and Video
- Use clips (5-15 minutes), not full documentaries, during class time. Assign full films for outside viewing.
- Always provide specific viewing questions or tasks (do not just say "watch and discuss")
- Discuss the film as a constructed representation, not transparent reality
- Ensure videos are captioned for accessibility

### Podcasts and Audio
- Assign for outside listening with guided questions
- In class, play short clips (3-5 minutes) to illustrate a point
- Have students analyze the podcast as a media form, not just its content

### Virtual Museum Tours and Digital Archives
- Provide structured activities (scavenger hunts, analysis worksheets) rather than unguided browsing
- Connect digital materials to course concepts
- Be prepared for technology problems

---

## Scaffolding Skills Across the Semester

### Reading Skills
- **Early semester:** Model close reading in class; provide reading guides with specific questions
- **Mid-semester:** Give less guidance; ask students to identify key arguments and evidence independently
- **Late semester:** Students should be reading critically and comparatively without prompts

### Writing Skills
- **Early semester:** Low-stakes writing (reading responses, in-class writing) with brief feedback
- **Mid-semester:** Drafts and peer review for major assignments; focus on argument construction
- **Late semester:** Independent writing with higher expectations for analysis and evidence

### Discussion Skills
- **Early semester:** Structured activities with clear roles and low risk (pair work, small groups)
- **Mid-semester:** Whole-class discussion with less structure; students practice building on each other's ideas
- **Late semester:** Student-led discussion; Socratic seminar; sustained analytical conversation

### Analytical Skills
- **Early semester:** Observation and description (what do you see? what does the author say?)
- **Mid-semester:** Comparison and analysis (how do these cases differ? what explains the variation?)
- **Late semester:** Evaluation and synthesis (which theoretical framework best accounts for this? what is your own argument?)

---

## In-Class Assessment

### Minute Papers
At the end of class, students write for 1-2 minutes in response to a prompt: "What was the most important idea from today?" or "What question do you still have?" Collect and review to inform the next session.

### Exit Tickets
A specific question or problem that students answer before leaving. Checks comprehension of a key concept. Can be on paper or digital.

### Concept Maps
Ask students to diagram relationships between key concepts from the session or unit. Reveals how students are organizing their understanding.

### Muddiest Point
Students identify the concept or idea they found most confusing. Review responses to identify common areas of confusion for the next session.

### One-Sentence Summary
Students summarize the main argument of a reading or the key takeaway from a session in one sentence. Reveals whether students can distinguish main ideas from supporting details.

---

## Adapting for Online Formats

### Synchronous Online
- Shorten sessions to 60-70% of in-person length (screen fatigue)
- Use breakout rooms for small group work (3-4 students per room)
- Build in more frequent transitions between activities
- Use the chat function as a participation channel (not just a sidebar)
- Have students turn cameras on when possible, but do not require it
- Record sessions for students who cannot attend (but note this changes discussion dynamics)

### Asynchronous
- Replace lecture with recorded mini-lectures (10-15 min maximum)
- Design structured discussion boards with clear expectations (initial post + responses)
- Create self-paced activities with firm deadlines
- Use collaborative documents (shared annotation of readings, group wikis)
- Provide detailed written instructions; you cannot clarify in real time
- Build in regular check-ins (weekly announcements, brief video messages) to maintain presence

### Hybrid
- Do not try to run the same session simultaneously for in-person and online students without dedicated technology and support
- Alternate which activities happen in each mode
- Use asynchronous components to create a shared baseline, then use synchronous time (whether in-person or online) for discussion and application
- Be transparent about the challenges of hybrid format and solicit student feedback

## Managing Group Work

### When Group Work Is and Is Not Appropriate
**Use group work for:** tasks that benefit from multiple perspectives, collaborative analysis, peer teaching, building communication skills, and distributing a workload that would be too large for individuals.
**Avoid group work for:** tasks that one student could do alone, high-stakes assessments where individual accountability matters, and situations where free-riding will undermine learning.

### Designing Effective Group Work
- Assign clear roles (facilitator, recorder, reporter, timekeeper)
- Give groups a specific product to create (not just "discuss")
- Set a time limit and check in at the halfway point
- Make groups small enough that everyone must contribute (3-4 students is ideal)
- Vary group composition across the semester

### Addressing Common Problems
- **Free-riding:** Build in individual accountability (each person submits something, peer evaluation)
- **Dominant members:** Assign roles that distribute participation; use structured protocols
- **Off-task groups:** Circulate actively; check in with each group during the activity
- **Unequal preparation:** Design tasks that can be completed even if not everyone did the reading, while still rewarding preparation
