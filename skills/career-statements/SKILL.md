# Career Statements for Anthropologists

Write professional philosophy statements (research, teaching, diversity) and
tenure/promotion narratives that articulate a coherent scholarly identity.
Career statements are arguments about who you are as a scholar -- they must
show trajectory (past to present to future), provide evidence of effectiveness,
and demonstrate fit with the target audience (search committee, tenure
committee, fellowship panel).

The central challenge: career statements require the author to step back from
specific projects and articulate a larger intellectual narrative. Most scholars
find this difficult because their daily work is project-level, not
narrative-level. The skill bridges that gap by scaffolding the move from
evidence (publications, courses, mentoring, service) to argument (who you are
as a scholar and where you are going).

## Quick Reference

| Task | Reference |
|------|-----------|
| Research statements, vision narratives, program-building framing | Read [references/research-statement-guide.md](references/research-statement-guide.md) |
| Teaching statements, philosophy articulation, evidence from practice | Read [references/teaching-statement-guide.md](references/teaching-statement-guide.md) |
| Diversity statements, concrete action framing, integrated DEI narrative | Read [references/diversity-statement-guide.md](references/diversity-statement-guide.md) |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Statement Type and Purpose

Determine which statement(s) the user needs and what context they serve.
Career statements appear in several distinct contexts, and the audience
shapes everything downstream: emphasis, register, length, and what counts
as persuasive evidence.

Ask the user if not immediately clear:

- **Which statement type?** Research statement, teaching statement/philosophy,
  diversity/DEI statement, or tenure/promotion narrative (which integrates
  all three).
- **What is the context?** Job application (search committee), tenure or
  promotion portfolio (tenure committee), fellowship application (fellowship
  panel), or annual review.
- **What institution type?** R1 research-intensive, SLAC teaching-focused,
  balanced institution, community college, applied/non-academic position.
  This determines emphasis and register.

If a specific statement type is identified, load the corresponding reference
file now. For tenure narratives that integrate multiple statement types,
load all relevant reference files.

### Step 2: Gather Context

Collect the information needed to write a statement that is specific,
evidence-backed, and tailored to the audience. Not all of this is needed
upfront -- gather what you can and note gaps.

**Required (statement cannot proceed without these):**
- Career stage: postdoc, early career (pre-tenure), mid-career (going up
  for tenure/promotion), senior (full professor, named chair)
- Position type: R1 research-intensive, SLAC teaching-focused, balanced,
  applied, or community college
- Statement type: research, teaching, diversity/DEI, or tenure narrative
- Target audience: search committee, tenure committee, fellowship panel,
  or other

**Important (strengthens the statement significantly):**
- Existing CV or publication list for evidence extraction
- Specific job posting, tenure guidelines, or fellowship criteria
- Current research projects and how they connect to past work
- Courses taught, designed, or planned
- Mentoring experience (graduate students, undergraduates, thesis advising)
- DEI-related activities, commitments, or institutional contributions

**Helpful (improves tailoring):**
- Prior statements to revise rather than write from scratch
- Page length requirements or word limits
- Department or institution culture and values
- Known preferences of the committee or audience
- Subfield positioning within anthropology

### Step 3: Load References

- **Always load** `references/research-statement-guide.md` when writing a
  research statement or the research component of a tenure narrative.
- **Always load** `references/teaching-statement-guide.md` when writing a
  teaching statement/philosophy or the teaching component of a tenure
  narrative.
- **Always load** `references/diversity-statement-guide.md` when writing a
  diversity/DEI statement or the DEI component of a tenure narrative.
- **Load all three** for tenure or promotion narratives, which require an
  integrated scholarly identity across research, teaching, and service.

### Step 4: Generate Content Using the Three-Arc Structure

All career statements follow a common narrative architecture: past work
leads to current projects, which set up a compelling future vision. This
past-present-future arc is the backbone of every effective career statement.

**Past:** What have you done? Ground claims in specific, verifiable evidence.
Publications, fieldwork, courses designed, students mentored, programs built,
communities engaged. The past section establishes credibility.

**Present:** What are you doing now? Describe current projects, ongoing
commitments, and active work. This section demonstrates momentum and shows
that the past work was not a dead end but part of a developing trajectory.

**Future:** Where are you going? Articulate a research program, teaching
agenda, or DEI vision that builds credibly on past and present work. The
future section must be ambitious but realistic -- reviewers are skeptical
of promises disconnected from track record.

The connecting thread across all three arcs must be explicit. What is the
through-line? For research statements, this might be a thematic question,
a methodological commitment, or a theoretical orientation. For teaching
statements, it might be a pedagogical philosophy that connects course
design choices. For diversity statements, it might be an integrated
commitment to equity that manifests across research, teaching, and service.

### Step 5: Generate Output

Produce a complete statement calibrated to the audience, institution type,
and length requirements. The output should:

- Open with a clear statement of scholarly identity (not biography)
- Present evidence organized by the three-arc structure
- Calibrate emphasis to the institution type: R1 statements foreground
  research trajectory and program-building; SLAC statements foreground
  teaching innovation and student engagement; balanced institutions
  need both
- Close with a forward-looking vision that connects to the target
  institution's mission and needs
- Meet length requirements without padding -- every paragraph should
  advance the argument

### Step 6: Quality Check

Before presenting the draft, verify:

- [ ] **Evidence-backed claims:** Every claim about effectiveness is
      supported by specific evidence (publications, student outcomes,
      course innovations, programs built), not just assertions
- [ ] **Trajectory is visible:** The statement shows development over time,
      not a static snapshot. The reader can trace from past work through
      current projects to future plans
- [ ] **Audience-appropriate register:** The tone, emphasis, and vocabulary
      match the target audience. R1 tenure committees expect different
      register than SLAC search committees
- [ ] **Not generic:** The statement could not describe any other scholar
      in the field. Specificity to the author's actual work is present
      throughout
- [ ] **Through-line is explicit:** The connecting thread across projects,
      courses, or commitments is stated, not left for the reader to infer
- [ ] **Institution fit:** The statement demonstrates awareness of the
      target institution's values, mission, and needs
- [ ] **Length compliance:** The output meets specified page or word limits
- [ ] **No unsupported promises:** Future plans are credible extensions of
      existing work, not aspirational claims disconnected from track record

## Parameters

- **Career stage:** Postdoc (emphasize potential and training), early career
  (emphasize trajectory and emerging program), mid-career/tenure (emphasize
  established program and impact), senior/promotion (emphasize leadership
  and field-shaping contributions). Stage determines what evidence is
  available and what reviewers expect.
- **Position type:** R1 research-intensive (research trajectory dominates),
  SLAC teaching-focused (teaching innovation and student mentoring dominate),
  balanced (both in roughly equal measure), applied (impact and engagement
  emphasized), community college (teaching and accessibility central).
- **Statement type:** Research statement, teaching statement/philosophy,
  diversity/DEI statement, tenure/promotion narrative (integrated).
- **Length:** 1-page (fellowship applications, short-form job materials),
  2-page (standard job applications), 3-page (tenure portfolios),
  portfolio-length (5+ pages for comprehensive tenure/promotion dossiers).
- **Audience:** Search committee (evaluating fit and potential), tenure
  committee (evaluating impact and trajectory), fellowship panel (evaluating
  promise and coherence), annual review (documenting progress).

## Guardrails

- **Statements must contain specific evidence, not just claims.** "I am a
  dedicated teacher" without evidence of dedication is an empty assertion.
  "I redesigned ANTH 101 to incorporate ethnographic fieldwork exercises,
  resulting in a 30% increase in students pursuing the major" is a claim
  backed by evidence. Push for specificity in every paragraph.
- **Research statements must show a coherent program, not a list of
  disconnected projects.** If the user's work spans multiple topics, the
  statement must articulate what connects them -- a shared theoretical
  commitment, a methodological through-line, a thematic arc, or a
  problem-space that unifies diverse projects.
- **Teaching statements must go beyond platitudes.** "Student-centered
  learning" and "active pedagogy" mean nothing without examples of what
  the author actually does in the classroom and why. Every pedagogical
  claim should be grounded in a specific practice and its rationale.
- **Diversity statements must describe concrete actions, not performative
  commitments.** "I am committed to diversity" is not a diversity statement.
  What courses did you design? What mentoring programs did you create or
  participate in? What institutional changes did you advocate for? What
  community partnerships did you build? Evidence of action, not declarations
  of values.
- **Do not produce generic statements that could apply to any scholar in
  any field.** If the statement reads as interchangeable with any other
  anthropologist's, it has failed. Specificity to the author's research
  questions, field sites, methods, courses, and institutional context is
  the minimum standard.
- **Tailor register and emphasis to the institution type.** An R1 tenure
  committee evaluates research productivity and program-building; a SLAC
  search committee evaluates teaching innovation and student impact; a
  balanced institution needs both. Writing a research-heavy statement for
  a SLAC position or a teaching-heavy statement for an R1 position
  misreads the audience.
- **Do not promise what the scholar has not done.** Future plans must be
  credible extensions of existing work. A scholar with no grant-funded
  projects should not claim they will build a $2M research lab. A scholar
  with no experience teaching large lectures should not promise to
  transform introductory curriculum at scale. Ambition is good; fantasy
  is not.

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure mode | What goes wrong | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| Autobiography instead of argument | Statement reads as a chronological life story rather than a narrative about scholarly identity and trajectory | Structure around themes and through-lines, not timeline; open with intellectual identity, not personal history |
| Project list without narrative | Research statement catalogs publications or projects without explaining what connects them or where the program is headed | Articulate the through-line explicitly; each project should be positioned as part of a larger intellectual agenda |
| Platitudes without evidence | Teaching statement uses buzzwords ("student-centered," "inclusive," "innovative") without specific examples of practice | For every pedagogical claim, provide at least one concrete example: a course design choice, a student outcome, a specific teaching strategy |
| Performative diversity | DEI statement declares values without describing actions; reads as checking a box rather than demonstrating genuine engagement | Organize around concrete actions across research, teaching, and service domains; evidence over declarations |
| Wrong audience, wrong emphasis | Research-heavy statement for a teaching-focused institution, or teaching-heavy statement for an R1 | Match emphasis to institution type; read the job ad or tenure guidelines for signals about what the committee values |
| All past, no future | Statement describes accomplished work thoroughly but offers no vision for where the scholar is headed | Dedicate at least 25-30% of the statement to future plans that build credibly on past work |
| Grandiose future claims | Future plans section promises transformative impact disconnected from actual track record and available resources | Ground every future claim in existing evidence: skills already developed, collaborations already initiated, preliminary work already completed |
| Generic institutional fit | Statement claims to be excited about the institution without naming anything specific about its programs, mission, or community | Reference specific departments, programs, colleagues, or institutional values that genuinely connect to the scholar's work |

## Examples

**Example 1: Early-career research statement for an R1 position**

Input: "I'm a postdoc applying for tenure-track positions at R1 departments.
My research is on the anthropology of infrastructure -- specifically how
communities in coastal Louisiana navigate oil industry decline and climate
change. I've done 18 months of fieldwork, have two articles published and
one under review, and I'm developing a second project on energy transition
labor. I need a 2-page research statement."

Output approach: Load research-statement-guide reference. Set parameters:
career stage = early career/postdoc; position type = R1; statement type =
research; length = 2 pages. Structure around the three-arc model. Past:
dissertation research on infrastructure and environmental change in coastal
Louisiana, grounding the statement in specific ethnographic findings and
publications. Present: current work extending the dissertation (article
under review, book manuscript in progress) plus emerging second project on
energy transition labor. Future: articulate a research program centered on
infrastructure, environment, and labor that positions both projects as part
of a coherent agenda. Show how the second project builds on skills and
networks from the first. Include brief mention of external funding plans
(e.g., planning NSF or NEH application) and collaboration trajectory.
Register: confident but not grandiose; demonstrate potential for a
productive research program without overclaiming.

**Example 2: Teaching statement for a SLAC position**

Input: "I'm applying to a small liberal arts college. I teach cultural
anthropology and medical anthropology. I've designed an ethnographic
methods course where students do semester-long community projects. I care
a lot about making anthropology accessible to first-generation college
students. I need a 1-page teaching statement."

Output approach: Load teaching-statement-guide reference. Set parameters:
career stage = early career; position type = SLAC; statement type = teaching;
length = 1 page. Open with a teaching philosophy grounded in specifics, not
platitudes -- what does the user actually believe about learning, and how
does that belief manifest in course design? Present the ethnographic methods
course as a centerpiece example: what do students do, what do they learn,
how does the community-project model reflect the teaching philosophy?
Address first-generation students with concrete strategies (not just
"I care about access"): scaffolded assignments, explicit instruction in
academic conventions, mentoring structures. Include what courses the user
would want to teach or develop at a SLAC. Close with a vision for how
anthropological teaching contributes to liberal arts education. Every
sentence should demonstrate what makes this teacher distinctive.

**Example 3: Diversity statement with concrete actions**

Input: "I need to write a diversity statement for my tenure file. I'm a
mid-career anthropologist at a public R1. My research is on immigration
and belonging in the US South. I've mentored several first-generation
graduate students, redesigned my intro course to include more non-Western
perspectives, and I co-founded a community advisory board for my research
that includes undocumented community members. I'm not sure how to frame
all this."

Output approach: Load diversity-statement-guide reference. Set parameters:
career stage = mid-career/tenure; position type = R1; statement type =
diversity/DEI; length = 2 pages (typical for tenure portfolios). Structure
around three domains of DEI engagement: research (community advisory board,
collaborative research design with immigrant communities, ethical
commitments in studying vulnerable populations), teaching (course redesign
with specific changes named, mentoring first-generation students with
concrete outcomes like publications or conference presentations), and
service/institutional (community advisory board as institutional innovation,
any committee work, recruitment efforts, program building). Open with
brief positionality context -- enough to ground the statement but without
centering the author's identity journey at the expense of describing
actions. Close with a vision for continued and expanded DEI contributions
at the institution. Every claim should be supported by a specific action
already taken, not a future intention.
