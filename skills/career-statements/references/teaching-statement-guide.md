# Teaching Statement Guide

Domain knowledge reference for writing teaching statements, teaching
philosophies, and the teaching component of tenure/promotion portfolios
for anthropologists. Covers philosophy articulation, evidence from practice,
audience calibration, and discipline-specific pedagogy.

## What a Teaching Statement Is

A teaching statement is an argument about what you believe learning is, how
you facilitate it, and what evidence you have that your approach works. It
is not a list of courses taught, a collection of student praise, or a
declaration of enthusiasm. The best teaching statements operate like
research statements for the classroom: they present a thesis (your
pedagogical philosophy), support it with evidence (your teaching practices
and their outcomes), and project a future trajectory (your plans for
continued pedagogical development).

**Key distinction:** A teaching statement is not a course proposal or
syllabus. It describes the principles that guide all your teaching, not the
content of any single course. Specific courses appear as evidence of
philosophy in action, not as the subject of the statement.

**Why this is hard for anthropologists:** Anthropologists are trained to
analyze culture, power, and meaning -- but rarely trained to articulate
their pedagogical reasoning with the same analytical rigor. The result
is often teaching statements that rely on buzzwords ("student-centered,"
"active learning," "critical thinking") without the ethnographic specificity
that the same scholar would demand of their research writing.

## Philosophy Articulation Beyond Platitudes

The opening of a teaching statement must articulate a genuine pedagogical
philosophy -- what the author actually believes about how learning happens
and what role the instructor plays. This is the thesis of the statement,
and everything that follows should support it.

### What a Philosophy Is Not

| Platitude | Why it fails | What to do instead |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| "I am a student-centered teacher" | Every applicant says this; it communicates nothing distinctive | Describe what student-centering looks like in your classroom. What decisions do students make? What agency do they have? |
| "I believe in active learning" | Too broad to be meaningful | Name the specific activities: simulations, fieldwork exercises, collaborative analysis, community projects. Explain why these work for your goals. |
| "I foster critical thinking" | Generic; every discipline claims this | Define what critical thinking means in anthropology specifically. How does ethnographic reasoning differ from generic analytical skills? |
| "I am passionate about teaching" | Declares emotion, not philosophy | Show passion through evidence: courses redesigned, new pedagogies developed, students mentored beyond requirements |
| "I create an inclusive classroom" | A claim without methodology | Describe the specific practices that create inclusion: assignment design, discussion facilitation, representation in readings, accessibility features |

### What a Philosophy Is

A teaching philosophy is a coherent position on three questions:

1. **What is learning in anthropology?** Not learning in general -- learning
   in your discipline specifically. What does it mean to think
   anthropologically, and what must students experience to develop that
   capacity?

2. **What is the instructor's role?** Different philosophies assign
   different roles: facilitator, guide, co-learner, expert, provocateur,
   mentor. Name your role and explain why it serves your learning goals.

3. **What evidence tells you whether it is working?** This is the most
   commonly missing element. How do you know your approach produces the
   learning you intend? What do you look for in student work, discussions,
   or evaluations?

### Grounding Philosophy in Anthropological Thinking

Anthropologists have distinctive pedagogical resources that other
disciplines lack. A strong teaching statement draws on these:

- **Ethnographic sensibility:** Teaching students to observe carefully, to
  question assumptions, to attend to context and perspective. This is not
  generic critical thinking -- it is a specific disciplinary skill.
- **Defamiliarization:** Anthropology makes the familiar strange and the
  strange familiar. How does this principle operate in your classroom?
- **Positionality and reflexivity:** Anthropology teaches that the observer
  is always situated. How does this translate into classroom practice?
- **Attention to power and difference:** Anthropology foregrounds
  inequality, cultural difference, and the politics of knowledge. How does
  this shape what and how you teach?
- **Fieldwork as pedagogy:** The signature method of cultural anthropology
  can be adapted as a teaching tool at all levels, from introductory
  observation exercises to advanced field schools.

## Evidence from Practice

A teaching statement without evidence is an opinion piece. Evidence
transforms claims into arguments. Every paragraph of the teaching statement
should include or point to specific evidence.

### Types of Evidence

| Evidence type | What it demonstrates | How to present it |
|---|---|---|
| Syllabi innovations | Intentional course design aligned with philosophy | Describe the design choice and its rationale. "I structured ANTH 101 around a semester-long neighborhood ethnography because..." |
| Student evaluations | Student perception of teaching effectiveness | Contextualize scores within department and institutional norms. Quote specific comments that illustrate your philosophy in action. Do not cherry-pick only superlatives. |
| Learning outcomes | Whether students achieved the intended learning | Describe what students produced and what it demonstrates: analytical essays, fieldwork projects, research presentations. |
| Course development | Initiative and pedagogical growth | Name courses you designed from scratch and what need they filled. Describe significant redesigns and why they were necessary. |
| Student trajectories | Long-term mentoring impact | Graduate students placed, undergraduates who pursued research, thesis advisees, students who continued to graduate school. |
| Peer observation | Collegial validation of teaching practice | If you have been observed by colleagues, note what they observed and any feedback incorporated. |
| Teaching awards or recognition | External validation | Mention briefly if relevant, but do not lead with awards -- lead with the practices that earned them. |
| Pedagogical scholarship | Intellectual engagement with teaching | If you have published on pedagogy or presented at teaching workshops, include this as evidence of reflective practice. |

### Contextualizing Student Evaluations

Student evaluations are imperfect instruments, and teaching statements
should engage with them honestly:

- **Present evaluations in context.** A 4.2/5.0 means different things at
  different institutions. Compare to departmental and institutional averages
  if available.
- **Acknowledge patterns.** If evaluations consistently praise discussion
  facilitation but note heavy workloads, address both. Selectively
  presenting only positive data undermines credibility.
- **Address known biases.** Research shows that student evaluations are
  affected by instructor gender, race, accent, and course difficulty. If
  relevant, briefly note this context without being defensive.
- **Use qualitative comments strategically.** A few well-chosen student
  comments that illustrate your philosophy in action are more powerful than
  aggregate scores. Quote comments that describe what students learned, not
  just whether they enjoyed the class.

## Pedagogical Strategies Specific to Anthropology

Teaching statements for anthropologists should demonstrate engagement with
discipline-specific pedagogical challenges and strategies. The following
are not required in every statement but represent the kinds of concrete
practices that distinguish a strong anthropology teaching statement.

### Ethnographic Exercises

- **Observation exercises:** Assignments that develop careful, systematic
  observation skills. Examples: field note writing in public spaces,
  mapping exercises, sensory ethnography assignments.
- **Mini-ethnographies:** Semester-long or multi-week projects where
  students conduct small-scale ethnographic research. Requires scaffolding
  (ethics discussion, methods training, analytical frameworks) and
  community access protocols even for introductory courses.
- **Interview practice:** Structured assignments in interview skills,
  including question design, active listening, and transcription analysis.

### Fieldwork Training

- **Field school pedagogy:** For programs with field schools, describe
  your approach to supervised fieldwork training, risk management, and
  the transition from classroom to field.
- **Research mentoring:** How you train undergraduate and graduate students
  in fieldwork methods, including ethical preparation, safety planning,
  and analytical skills.
- **Collaborative fieldwork:** If students participate in your research
  projects, describe the pedagogical design: what roles do students play,
  what do they learn, and how is the collaboration structured ethically?

### Cultural Sensitivity and Cross-Cultural Pedagogy

- **Navigating difficult topics:** Anthropology courses frequently address
  sensitive topics: violence, inequality, racism, colonialism, sexuality,
  religion, death. Describe your approach to creating a classroom
  environment where these topics can be discussed rigorously and
  respectfully.
- **Decentering Western perspectives:** How do you ensure that non-Western
  knowledge, scholars, and perspectives are not marginalized in your
  curriculum? This is not about adding a week on "the non-Western world"
  -- it is about how the course is structured.
- **Engaging diverse student backgrounds:** Anthropology classrooms often
  include students from the communities being discussed. How do you
  navigate the dynamics when students have lived experience of the topics
  under study?

### Decolonizing Curricula

- **Syllabi design:** How do your reading lists reflect diverse voices,
  including scholars from the Global South, Indigenous scholars, and
  scholars of color? This is not a checklist -- explain the intellectual
  rationale for curricular choices.
- **Pedagogical approach:** Decolonizing pedagogy goes beyond reading
  lists to include how knowledge is produced and valued in the classroom.
  How do you decenter the lecture-as-authority model? How do you value
  experiential and community knowledge alongside published scholarship?
- **Reflexivity about the discipline:** Anthropology has a colonial
  history. How do you address this in your teaching, and how does it
  shape your approach to ethnographic representation?

---

## Addressing Diverse Learners

Teaching statements should demonstrate attention to the full range of
students in the classroom.

### Inclusive Pedagogy

- **Universal Design for Learning (UDL):** If you use UDL principles,
  describe specific implementations: multiple means of engagement,
  representation, and expression in your course design.
- **Accessibility:** Describe concrete accommodations and proactive design
  choices that make your courses accessible to students with disabilities.
  This includes syllabus design, assignment flexibility, multimedia use,
  and physical classroom setup.
- **First-generation students:** If relevant to the institution, describe
  strategies for supporting students who are the first in their families
  to attend college: explicit instruction in academic conventions,
  scaffolded assignments, mentoring beyond the classroom.

### Multi-Level Instruction

- **Introductory courses:** How do you make anthropology accessible and
  compelling to students who have never encountered the discipline? What
  are the threshold concepts you prioritize?
- **Upper-division seminars:** How do you facilitate advanced analytical
  discussion and guide students toward independent research?
- **Graduate instruction:** How do you mentor graduate students toward
  professional competence in research, writing, and teaching?

## Tailoring to Institution Types

### R1 Research-Intensive

**What the committee values in the teaching statement:**
- Evidence that teaching is competent and does not compete with research
  productivity (yes, this is the subtext)
- Graduate student mentoring as integrated with the research program
- Innovative course offerings that attract graduate students and enhance
  the department's curricular profile
- Evidence of reflective practice, not just survival

**Framing strategies:**
- Connect teaching to research: courses that grow from the research
  program, students who participate in research, seminars that develop
  from fieldwork insights
- Emphasize graduate mentoring and advanced pedagogy alongside
  introductory teaching
- Keep the statement focused and efficient (1-2 pages)
- Demonstrate that you can teach the department's core courses as well
  as your own specialty offerings

### SLAC (Small Liberal Arts Colleges)

**What the committee values in the teaching statement:**
- Teaching as the central mission of the position, not a secondary
  obligation
- Deep commitment to undergraduate education and mentoring
- Innovative, engaging pedagogy that brings anthropology alive for
  undergraduates
- Curriculum development vision: what courses would you build? How do
  they serve the department and the broader curriculum?
- Advising and mentoring as integral to the role
- Connection to the liberal arts mission

**Framing strategies:**
- Lead with teaching philosophy and evidence of effectiveness
- Describe specific courses designed or redesigned with attention to
  undergraduate learning
- Emphasize experiential learning: fieldwork exercises, community
  engagement, applied projects
- Connect anthropology to the broader liberal arts: how does
  ethnographic thinking contribute to a liberal education?
- Discuss advising philosophy and practice
- Show enthusiasm for the teaching mission without being sycophantic

### Balanced Institutions

**What the committee values in the teaching statement:**
- Evidence that both teaching and research are valued and integrated
- Teaching that is informed by research and research that informs teaching
- Flexibility across levels (introductory to graduate)
- Course development that serves department needs while reflecting
  scholarly expertise

**Framing strategies:**
- Give equal analytical weight to teaching philosophy and evidence
- Show research-teaching integration as a genuine intellectual practice
- Describe course offerings at multiple levels
- Demonstrate capacity to sustain quality teaching alongside a
  research program

---

## Course Development Narrative

A teaching statement should include a forward-looking component: what
courses the scholar would teach, develop, or redesign at the target
institution.

**What to include:**
- Courses already designed and taught, with evidence of their
  effectiveness
- Courses the scholar would want to develop, connected to their research
  expertise and the department's curricular needs
- How proposed courses fill gaps in the existing curriculum or complement
  existing offerings (this requires reading the department's course
  catalog)
- Signature pedagogical approaches that would characterize new course
  offerings

**What to avoid:**
- Proposing only esoteric seminars on narrow research topics. Departments
  need people who can teach introductory courses, methods courses, and
  core requirements, not just specialized topics.
- Ignoring the existing curriculum. Proposing a course the department
  already offers (without noting that you would teach the existing
  course) suggests you have not done your homework.
- Listing courses without pedagogical rationale. Why these courses?
  What will students learn? How do they connect to your teaching
  philosophy?

---

## Mentoring Narrative

For tenure-track and tenured positions, mentoring is an expected part
of the teaching statement.

### Graduate Student Mentoring

- **Advising approach:** How do you guide dissertation research? What is
  your philosophy on advisor-advisee relationships?
- **Professional development:** How do you prepare graduate students for
  the job market, grant writing, publishing, and teaching?
- **Outcomes:** Where have your advisees been placed? What have they
  published? What grants have they received?
- **Inclusivity in mentoring:** How do you support students from diverse
  backgrounds, including first-generation graduate students?

### Undergraduate Research Mentoring

- **Incorporating students into research:** How do undergraduates
  participate in your research program?
- **Thesis advising:** Your approach to guiding honors or capstone
  projects
- **Outcomes:** Students who presented at conferences, published,
  received research awards, or continued to graduate school

## Structure: The Four-Part Teaching Statement

### Part 1: Philosophy (Opening)

State your teaching philosophy in 1-2 paragraphs. Ground it in specifics,
not platitudes. Name the 2-3 principles that guide all your teaching and
explain why they matter for anthropology specifically.

### Part 2: Evidence from Practice (Core)

This is the longest section. Present 2-4 specific examples of your
philosophy in action. Each example should:
- Name the course or context
- Describe the specific pedagogical choice
- Explain how it enacts your philosophy
- Present evidence of its effectiveness (student work, outcomes,
  evaluations)

### Part 3: Course Development and Future Teaching (Forward-Looking)

Describe what you would teach at the target institution and what new
courses you would develop. Connect proposed courses to your philosophy
and to the department's needs.

### Part 4: Mentoring and Advising (Closing)

Describe your approach to mentoring at whatever level is appropriate to
the position (undergraduate, graduate, or both). Include evidence of
mentoring effectiveness.

## Common Failure Modes Specific to Teaching Statements

| Failure mode | What goes wrong | How to fix |
|---|---|---|
| All philosophy, no evidence | Statement reads as abstract theorizing about education without concrete examples | For every principle stated, provide at least one specific example from actual teaching practice |
| List of courses taught | Statement catalogs courses and enrollment numbers without reflection on what was taught or learned | Describe 2-4 courses selectively, focusing on design choices, pedagogical innovations, and evidence of learning |
| Generic "student-centered" claims | Every sentence could apply to any instructor in any discipline | Ground every claim in anthropology-specific practice: ethnographic exercises, cross-cultural engagement, fieldwork pedagogy |
| No connection to discipline | Teaching philosophy reads as generic pedagogy disconnected from anthropological content and methods | Explicitly connect pedagogical choices to what makes anthropology distinctive: ethnographic sensibility, cultural comparison, reflexivity |
| Neglecting the audience | Same statement sent to R1 and SLAC without adaptation | Tailor emphasis: R1 foregrounds research-teaching integration and graduate mentoring; SLAC foregrounds undergraduate engagement and curriculum development |
| No evidence of growth | Statement describes a static teaching practice with no indication of development or improvement over time | Include at least one example of a course redesigned, a pedagogy revised based on feedback, or a new approach adopted |
| Ignoring introductory teaching | Statement discusses only advanced or specialized courses | Departments need people who can teach introductory anthropology. Show that you take introductory teaching seriously and bring the same pedagogical intentionality to it |
| Defensive tone about evaluations | Statement pre-emptively explains away poor evaluations or avoids mentioning them entirely | Engage with evaluations honestly. Note strengths and areas of growth. Contextualize scores within institutional norms. |

## Length Norms by Context

| Context | Typical length | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Job application (any institution) | 1-2 pages | Concise, focused, evidence-rich. Most committees skim beyond 2 pages. |
| Tenure portfolio (teaching-focused) | 2-4 pages | More depth on evidence and outcomes. May include course development narrative. |
| Tenure portfolio (research-focused) | 1-2 pages | Sufficient to demonstrate competence and intentionality. |
| Teaching award application | 2-3 pages | Often includes more evidence of impact and innovation. |
| Promotion to full professor | 2-3 pages | Emphasizes mentoring, curriculum leadership, and sustained effectiveness. |
