# Research Statement Guide

Domain knowledge reference for writing research statements, research vision
narratives, and the research component of tenure/promotion portfolios for
anthropologists. Covers structure, audience calibration, program-building
narrative, and common failure modes.

## What a Research Statement Is

A research statement is an argument about intellectual identity and trajectory.
It answers three questions simultaneously: What have you done? What are you
doing now? Where are you going? The answers must cohere into a single
narrative that positions the author as someone building a program, not just
completing projects.

Research statements are not CVs in prose form. A CV lists accomplishments;
a research statement explains what connects them, what drives them, and why
they matter. The reader should finish the statement understanding not just
what the scholar has published but what problem-space they inhabit and what
they will contribute next.

**Key distinction:** Research statements describe a program; grant proposals
describe a project. A research statement uses individual projects as evidence
for a larger intellectual agenda. Grant proposals focus on a single project's
design, methods, and feasibility. The two documents overlap but serve
different purposes and require different framing.

---

## The Three-Arc Model

Every research statement is built on three arcs: past work, current projects,
and future vision. These arcs are not merely chronological sections -- they
are argumentative moves that together build the case for the scholar's
intellectual trajectory.

### Arc 1: Past Work (Establishing Credibility)

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that you have a track record of producing meaningful
scholarship. The past arc grounds the statement in verifiable evidence.

**What to include:**
- Dissertation research: core questions, key findings, theoretical contribution.
  This is the origin point of the research program for early-career scholars.
- Published work: frame publications as evidence of a developing program, not
  a list. Name 2-4 key publications and explain what each contributes to the
  larger trajectory. Do not list every publication -- select strategically.
- Fieldwork: duration, sites, methods, and what the fieldwork produced
  (ethnographic insights, data, relationships, community partnerships).
- Awards, grants, and recognition as credibility markers -- but only if they
  add information the publications do not already convey.

**What to avoid:**
- Summarizing every publication or project. Select the ones that best
  illustrate the through-line.
- Pure chronology. Organize around themes or questions, not timeline.
- Excessive detail about methods or findings that belong in the publications
  themselves.
- Relegating collaborative work. If the scholar has co-authored or
  collaborated, name their specific contribution to joint projects.

**Calibrating by career stage:**

| Stage | Past arc emphasis | Typical evidence |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Postdoc | Dissertation as foundation; reframe for broader audience | Dissertation, 1-3 publications, fieldwork experience |
| Early career (pre-tenure) | Dissertation plus post-dissertation development | 4-10 publications, additional fieldwork, early grants |
| Mid-career (tenure) | Established body of work; thematic coherence across projects | Book(s), 15+ articles, sustained funding, mentored students |
| Senior (promotion) | Field-shaping contributions; legacy and influence | Major publications, edited volumes, named lectures, awards |

### Arc 2: Current Projects (Demonstrating Momentum)

**Purpose:** Show that the scholar is actively producing work, not resting
on past accomplishments. The current arc demonstrates momentum and signals
that the intellectual agenda is alive and developing.

**What to include:**
- Projects currently underway: what questions are being investigated, what
  stage is the work at, what outputs are expected.
- The publication pipeline: manuscripts in preparation, under review, or
  forthcoming. Be honest about stages -- reviewers value transparency.
- Active grants and funded projects: what is currently supported and what
  it enables.
- Ongoing fieldwork or data collection: sites, methods, timeline.
- Collaborations in progress: who the scholar is working with and why.

**What to avoid:**
- Describing current work in past tense. This section should feel active
  and ongoing.
- Listing works "in preparation" without any indication of substance or
  timeline. One or two in-preparation manuscripts are credible; five
  signals disorganization.
- Disconnecting current work from the past arc. The reader should see how
  current projects grow from or build on earlier work.

**Transition from past to present:** The most effective research statements
make the transition between Arc 1 and Arc 2 feel inevitable. The past work
raised questions, developed methods, or revealed puzzles that the current
work addresses. Make this connection explicit.

### Arc 3: Future Vision (Projecting Trajectory)

**Purpose:** Articulate where the research program is headed. The future arc
is the most forward-looking and aspirational section, but it must remain
grounded in what the past and present arcs have established.

**What to include:**
- Next major project(s): 1-2 projects described in enough detail to be
  credible but not so much detail that the statement becomes a grant
  proposal. Name the questions, the sites or data sources, and the
  expected contribution.
- How the next project builds on existing work: what skills, networks,
  data, or theoretical insights from past work make the future project
  feasible and coherent with the overall program.
- Funding plans: which grants or fellowships will be pursued. Be specific
  about funders and programs where possible (e.g., "I plan to apply for
  an NSF Cultural Anthropology grant" rather than "I plan to seek external
  funding").
- Publication trajectory: book plans, article series, edited volumes, or
  other outputs that will result from the future work.
- Broader impact and significance: why the future research matters beyond
  the discipline.

**What to avoid:**
- Grandiose claims disconnected from track record. If the scholar has never
  directed a lab, promising to build a major research center is not credible.
- Vague aspirations. "I plan to continue exploring questions of belonging"
  is not a future vision. "My next project will examine how climate
  displacement reshapes kinship networks in Pacific Island diasporas,
  building on my existing network of collaborators in Fiji and New Zealand"
  is a future vision.
- Promising too many projects. One well-developed future project plus one
  emerging interest is more credible than four projects in sketch form.
- Ignoring the target institution. Future plans should connect to what the
  institution offers: particular departments, centers, collaborators,
  resources, or student populations.

**Calibrating future vision by career stage:**

| Stage | Future arc scope | Key signals to reviewers |
|-------|------------------|------------------------|
| Postdoc | Ambitious but bounded; 1 major next project | "This person has a clear plan and the skills to execute it" |
| Early career | 1 major project + 1 emerging direction | "This person is building a coherent and productive program" |
| Mid-career | Program-level vision; integration across multiple projects | "This person has a sustained and evolving research agenda" |
| Senior | Field-shaping vision; mentoring the next generation of scholars | "This person is a leader whose work defines the conversation" |

---

## Articulating the Through-Line

The through-line is the single most important element of a research statement.
It is the intellectual thread that connects all projects, past, present, and
future, into a coherent program. Without a through-line, the statement reads
as a list of things the scholar has done. With a through-line, it reads as
an argument about who the scholar is.

**Types of through-lines:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Thematic | A sustained question or problem-space | "How do communities make decisions about environmental futures under conditions of radical uncertainty?" |
| Methodological | A distinctive approach applied across topics | "I combine long-term ethnographic fieldwork with computational text analysis to study how institutional language shapes lived experience" |
| Theoretical | A theoretical commitment or framework | "My work develops an anthropology of repair that examines how people reconstitute social worlds after disruption" |
| Regional | Deep engagement with a place or community | "Twenty years of collaborative research with Navajo communities grounds all my work in questions of sovereignty, language, and land" |
| Population-centered | Focus on a specific community across contexts | "My research follows migrant agricultural workers across national borders to understand how labor, health, and belonging intersect" |

**Articulating the through-line when work seems scattered:** Many scholars
have genuinely diverse research portfolios. The through-line is not always
obvious, and sometimes it must be constructed rather than discovered.
Strategies for finding coherence:

1. **Ask what question animates everything.** Even projects on different
   topics often share an underlying puzzle about how people navigate
   uncertainty, how power operates through institutions, or how meaning
   is made in the face of change.
2. **Look for shared methods.** A scholar who uses ethnographic methods
   across diverse topics has a methodological through-line even if the
   thematic connections are loose.
3. **Find the theoretical commitment.** Projects on different topics may
   share a theoretical orientation -- political economy, phenomenology,
   STS, feminist theory -- that provides coherence.
4. **Name the contribution space.** Even diverse projects may contribute
   to the same disciplinary conversation (e.g., "the anthropology of
   the state" or "critical studies of science and technology").

## Positioning for Different Institution Types

The same scholar's research statement should read differently depending
on the audience. The core content remains the same, but emphasis, register,
and framing shift.

### R1 Research-Intensive Institutions

**What the committee values:**
- A productive and funded research program with a clear trajectory
- Evidence of external funding (past and planned)
- A publication record appropriate to career stage, with evidence of
  ongoing productivity
- Capacity to mentor graduate students in research
- Potential for program-building: will this person bring visibility,
  grants, and graduate students to the department?

**Framing strategies:**
- Lead with the research program's intellectual significance and
  theoretical contribution
- Emphasize the publication pipeline and funding trajectory
- Describe how the research connects to and strengthens the department's
  existing strengths
- Include graduate student mentoring as part of the research program
  (not separate from it)
- Name specific grants you plan to apply for and why they are feasible
  given your track record

### SLAC (Small Liberal Arts Colleges)

**What the committee values:**
- Research that is active and ongoing but does not require resources the
  college cannot provide
- Research that creates opportunities for undergraduate involvement
- A scholar who can explain their research to non-specialists and to
  students
- Research that connects to the liberal arts mission and to
  interdisciplinary conversation
- Evidence that teaching and research are integrated, not competing

**Framing strategies:**
- Lead with the intellectual questions that drive the research (accessible
  framing)
- Emphasize how research informs teaching and how students participate
  in research
- Describe projects that are feasible without extensive lab infrastructure
  or large teams
- Show how the research connects to other departments or programs at the
  college
- Frame fieldwork as a model for experiential learning

### Balanced Institutions

**What the committee values:**
- Both a productive research program and evidence of teaching effectiveness
- Research that is ambitious but realistic given a heavier teaching load
  than R1
- Evidence that the scholar can maintain research momentum alongside
  teaching commitments
- Research-teaching integration as a strength, not a compromise

**Framing strategies:**
- Give roughly equal weight to research trajectory and research-teaching
  connections
- Show how research productivity has been sustained alongside teaching
  (if applicable)
- Frame research projects with realistic timelines that account for
  teaching loads
- Describe how research feeds back into curricular development

---

## The Funding Narrative

For R1 and research-intensive positions, the research statement must include
a funding narrative: where has funding come from, what is pending, and what
will be pursued next.

**Structure:**
1. **Past funding:** Name grants received, amounts if substantial, and what
   they enabled. Frame grants as evidence of peer-reviewed competitiveness
   and as resources that made the research possible.
2. **Current/pending funding:** Describe any active grants or pending
   applications. Be honest about what is pending vs. confirmed.
3. **Planned funding:** Name specific programs and funders. "I plan to
   apply for an NSF Cultural Anthropology grant to support the second phase
   of this project" is more credible than "I plan to seek external funding."

**Calibrating the funding narrative by career stage:**
- **Postdoc/early career:** Dissertation grants (Wenner-Gren, Fulbright,
  NSF DDRIG) plus plans for early-career grants. It is acceptable to have
  limited funding at this stage; what matters is a credible plan.
- **Mid-career (tenure):** A record of funded research appropriate to the
  field. In anthropology, this may include smaller grants (Wenner-Gren
  Post-PhD, NEH fellowships) rather than large NIH or NSF standard grants.
  Contextualize the funding record within disciplinary norms.
- **Senior:** Sustained funding record; larger grants or collaborative
  projects; evidence of supporting junior scholars through shared funding.

---

## The Publication Strategy Narrative

Reviewers want to understand not just what the scholar has published but
what the publication trajectory looks like going forward.

**What to include:**
- Current publication pipeline: manuscripts at various stages (under
  review, in revision, in preparation)
- Book plans: if a book is planned or in progress, describe the project
  and its status (under contract, proposal submitted, in drafting)
- Target outlets: where the scholar publishes and plans to publish, and
  why those venues are appropriate
- Collaborative publications: if co-authored work is significant, describe
  the scholar's role and contribution

**What to avoid:**
- Listing every publication. The CV does that. The statement should
  selectively present publications that illustrate the trajectory.
- Inflating the pipeline. "Five manuscripts in preparation" without
  evidence of productivity raises skepticism. Be honest about stages.
- Ignoring the book question. In many anthropology departments, the
  monograph remains the tenure benchmark. If a book is expected, address it.

---

## Collaboration and Mentoring Narrative

For R1 and tenure contexts, the research statement should include how the
scholar collaborates with others and mentors the next generation. This is
especially important at mid-career and senior stages.

**Collaboration:**
- Name key collaborators and what the collaboration produces
- Describe collaborative projects and the scholar's specific role
- Frame collaboration as a strength that expands the research program,
  not as dependence on others
- For interdisciplinary collaboration: explain what anthropology brings
  to the partnership and what the scholar gains

**Mentoring:**
- Graduate student mentoring: how many students advised, dissertation
  topics, outcomes (placements, publications, grants)
- Undergraduate research mentoring: how students are incorporated into
  the research program
- Postdoc mentoring: if applicable, how the scholar supports early-career
  development
- Frame mentoring as part of the intellectual project, not separate
  service work

## Common Failure Modes Specific to Research Statements

| Failure mode | What goes wrong | How to fix |
|---|---|---|
| All past, no vision | Statement describes completed work thoroughly but offers no sense of where the program is headed | Dedicate 25-30% of the statement to future plans. Frame past work as setting up the next phase. |
| Grandiose claims without evidence | "This project will transform the field" without specifying how or providing evidence of capacity | Ground claims in what has already been accomplished. Use language like "builds on" and "extends" rather than "transforms" and "revolutionizes." |
| Project list without narrative | Publications and projects are cataloged without a connecting through-line | Identify and state the through-line explicitly. Open the statement with it. Return to it in transitions between projects. |
| No theoretical coherence | Projects seem to exist in different intellectual universes with no shared theoretical commitment | Find the shared question or framework. If work genuinely spans disconnected areas, frame this as methodological breadth or a commitment to a broad problem-space. |
| Dissertation-only statement | The entire statement is about the dissertation with no evidence of post-dissertation development | Even for postdocs, the statement should point beyond the dissertation. Describe how the dissertation raises new questions, how published articles extend it, and what comes next. |
| Funding gap without explanation | At mid-career, no external funding is mentioned, which signals a gap at R1 institutions | If the scholar has not received major grants, contextualize within disciplinary norms (anthropology grants are smaller than STEM) and describe a concrete funding plan. |
| Generic program description | "My research examines the relationship between culture and power" could describe half the discipline | Be specific. Name sites, methods, populations, and theoretical frameworks. The reader should know exactly what distinguishes this program from others. |
| Ignoring the audience | Same statement sent to R1, SLAC, and balanced institutions without adaptation | Customize emphasis for each institution type. The core content stays; the framing and emphasis shift. |

## Sample Structure Outlines

### 1-Page Research Statement (Fellowship Applications, Short-Form Job Materials)

Every sentence must earn its place. No throat-clearing.

| Section | Approximate proportion | Content |
|---------|----------------------|---------|
| Opening | 2-3 sentences | Scholarly identity and through-line in one statement. What is the animating question? |
| Past work | 1 paragraph (30%) | Key findings and publications. Selective -- 2-3 highlights maximum. |
| Current work | 1 paragraph (25%) | What is underway now. Active projects, pipeline. |
| Future vision | 1 paragraph (30%) | Next project. Concrete, credible, connected to past work. |
| Closing | 1-2 sentences (15%) | Significance and institutional fit. Why does this program matter? |

### 2-Page Research Statement (Standard Job Applications)

The most common format. Allows some elaboration but still requires discipline.

| Section | Approximate proportion | Content |
|---------|----------------------|---------|
| Opening paragraph | 10% | Scholarly identity, through-line, research program overview |
| Past work | 2-3 paragraphs (30%) | Dissertation findings, key publications, fieldwork evidence. Organized thematically, not chronologically. |
| Current projects | 1-2 paragraphs (20%) | Active work, publication pipeline, ongoing fieldwork or analysis. Transition from past that shows development. |
| Future vision | 2 paragraphs (25%) | Next major project in detail. Second emerging direction briefly. Funding plans. |
| Institutional fit and significance | 1 paragraph (15%) | How the program connects to the target department. Broader significance. Collaboration potential. |

### 3-Page Research Statement (Tenure Portfolios)

Allows for depth. Common in tenure and promotion dossiers where the
committee needs a comprehensive picture.

| Section | Approximate proportion | Content |
|---------|----------------------|---------|
| Opening | 1 paragraph (8%) | Scholarly identity and program overview |
| Research program overview | 1-2 paragraphs (12%) | Through-line, theoretical commitments, methodological approach |
| Past work in depth | 3-4 paragraphs (25%) | Major projects, key publications, fieldwork, and their contributions. Organized by theme or project cluster. |
| Current projects | 2 paragraphs (15%) | Active work, publication pipeline, funded projects |
| Future vision | 2-3 paragraphs (20%) | Next major project(s), funding plans, publication trajectory |
| Collaboration and mentoring | 1-2 paragraphs (10%) | Graduate and undergraduate mentoring, collaborative projects |
| Significance and institutional contribution | 1 paragraph (10%) | Broader impact, departmental contribution, field-level significance |

## Integration with Cover Letter

The research statement and cover letter inevitably overlap -- both describe
the scholar's research. To avoid redundancy:

- **Cover letter:** Brief overview of the research program (2-3 sentences),
  emphasis on fit with the specific position and department, forward-looking.
  The cover letter introduces; it does not duplicate.
- **Research statement:** Full articulation of the program with evidence,
  trajectory, and vision. The research statement develops what the cover
  letter previews.

The cover letter should make the reader want to read the research statement.
The research statement should deliver on what the cover letter promises.

---

## Subfield-Specific Considerations

### Ethnographic Research

- **Fieldwork timelines:** Ethnographic fieldwork takes time. Research
  statements should contextualize timelines for non-anthropologist readers
  on interdisciplinary committees. 12-18 months of fieldwork is standard
  for a dissertation project; shorter periods for subsequent projects are
  normal but should be explained.
- **Site relationships:** Long-term relationships with field communities
  are a strength. Describe ongoing engagement with field sites as evidence
  of depth and ethical commitment, not just as logistics.
- **Single-site depth vs. multi-sited breadth:** Both are legitimate
  research designs. Frame the choice as intellectual (what questions the
  design serves) rather than pragmatic.

### Collaborative and Community-Based Research

- **Co-production:** If research involves community co-production, describe the collaborative relationship and how knowledge is shared.
- **Authorship and credit:** Be transparent about collaborative contributions. Name co-investigators and community partners.
- **Outputs beyond publications:** Community reports, policy briefs, exhibitions, and digital resources are legitimate research outputs and should be included in the trajectory narrative.

### Archival and Historical Research

- **Archive as field site:** Frame archival work as a form of fieldwork with its own methods, challenges, and ethical considerations.
- **Source access:** Describe access to archives as a feasibility signal, analogous to field access in ethnographic research.

### Digital and Computational Anthropology

- **Methods transparency:** Describe computational methods clearly for committee members who may be unfamiliar. Explain what they enable analytically.
- **Integration with ethnographic methods:** Show how computational and ethnographic approaches complement each other rather than treating them as separate tracks.
