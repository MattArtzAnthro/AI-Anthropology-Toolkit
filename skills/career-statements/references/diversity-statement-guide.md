# Diversity Statement Guide

Domain knowledge reference for writing diversity statements, DEI statements,
and the diversity/equity/inclusion component of tenure/promotion portfolios
for anthropologists. Covers frameworks for concrete action, integration with
scholarly identity, and strategies for avoiding performative rhetoric.

## What a Diversity Statement Is

A diversity statement is an argument about what you have done, are doing,
and will do to advance equity, inclusion, and justice in your professional
work. It is not a personal essay about identity, a list of values you hold,
or a recitation of institutional DEI language. The strongest diversity
statements present concrete evidence of action across multiple domains --
research, teaching, and service/institutional engagement -- and articulate
a vision for continued contribution.

**Key distinction:** A diversity statement is about actions and their
outcomes, not about beliefs or identity. Committees do not need to know
that you value diversity -- they need to see what you have done because
you value it. The statement should answer: What have you built, changed,
created, or sustained that advances equity?

**Why anthropologists have an advantage and a risk:** Anthropologists often
study inequality, marginalization, and cultural difference. This creates
an advantage -- the work itself may demonstrate deep engagement with DEI
questions. But it also creates a risk: conflating research on marginalized
communities with personal commitment to diversity work. Studying inequality
is not the same as doing equity work, and diversity statements must
demonstrate the latter.

## Frameworks for Diversity Work: Evidence Over Declarations

The most effective diversity statements are organized around concrete
evidence of action. Abstract commitments and institutional language fail
because they are indistinguishable from one applicant to the next. What
distinguishes a strong diversity statement is specificity: what the
scholar did, why they did it, what resulted, and what they learned.

### The Action-Evidence-Impact Structure

For each DEI contribution, present three elements:

1. **Action:** What specifically did you do? Name the activity, the
   context, and your role.
2. **Evidence:** What is the verifiable record of this action? A course
   syllabus, a mentoring relationship, a program created, a committee
   served on, a community partnership established.
3. **Impact:** What changed as a result? Student outcomes, institutional
   practices, community relationships, access expanded, barriers reduced.

**Example of the structure in practice:**

Weak: "I am committed to mentoring students from underrepresented
backgrounds."

Strong: "Since 2019, I have mentored seven first-generation graduate
students through the McNair Scholars Program, working with each on
research design, conference presentations, and graduate school
applications. Five of the seven are now enrolled in PhD programs in
anthropology or related fields. This experience led me to develop a
writing workshop series specifically designed for first-generation
graduate students, which has served 25 students across three departments."

## Three Domains of DEI Engagement

Diversity work in academia occurs across three domains. Strong diversity
statements present evidence in at least two of these domains, and the
strongest statements show integration across all three.

### Domain 1: Research

DEI engagement through research involves how the scholar's intellectual
work addresses questions of equity, justice, and inclusion -- and how
the research process itself embodies ethical and equitable practices.

**Evidence in this domain may include:**

- Research topics that directly address inequality, marginalization,
  discrimination, or justice
- Community-based participatory research methods that share authority
  with research participants
- Collaborative research relationships with communities that have been
  historically excluded from knowledge production
- Research outputs that benefit the communities studied: community
  reports, policy briefs, public scholarship, accessible publications
- Ethical practices in fieldwork that go beyond IRB compliance: informed
  consent processes designed with the community, data sovereignty
  agreements, shared governance of research outputs
- Mentoring community members as co-researchers or co-authors
- Research on the anthropology of education, health disparities, racial
  inequality, Indigenous rights, disability, gender, sexuality, migration,
  or related topics

**Caution:** Studying marginalized communities does not automatically
constitute diversity work. The statement should describe how the research
process is equitable, not just that the research topic involves inequality.
A scholar who extracts data from a marginalized community without
reciprocity is not doing diversity work -- they are doing extractive
research on a diversity-related topic.

### Domain 2: Teaching

DEI engagement through teaching involves how the scholar designs courses,
creates classroom environments, and mentors students in ways that promote
equity and inclusion.

**Evidence in this domain may include:**

- Course design: syllabi that center diverse voices, include scholars from
  the Global South and scholars of color, engage with Indigenous knowledge
  systems, or address structural inequality as a core theme (not an
  add-on week)
- Inclusive pedagogy: specific practices that make the classroom accessible
  and welcoming. Examples: multiple assessment formats, discussion
  protocols that distribute participation, trigger warnings with
  pedagogical rationale, culturally responsive teaching strategies
- Universal Design for Learning: proactive course design that serves
  students with diverse learning needs without requiring individual
  accommodations
- Mentoring underrepresented students: advising students from backgrounds
  underrepresented in anthropology, supporting their professional
  development, writing recommendation letters, connecting them to
  opportunities
- Addressing anthropology's colonial history: how the scholar engages
  students with the discipline's complicity in colonialism, racism, and
  extraction, and how this shapes their approach to ethnographic
  representation
- Teaching in diverse settings: community colleges, prison education
  programs, community workshops, public engagement venues
- Developing new courses that fill curricular gaps in diversity, equity,
  and inclusion

### Domain 3: Service and Institutional Engagement

DEI engagement through service involves how the scholar contributes to
institutional change, community partnerships, and professional
organizations.

**Evidence in this domain may include:**

- Committee service: diversity committees, hiring committees with
  attention to equitable practices, curriculum review committees
- Program building: creating or supporting programs that advance equity,
  such as pipeline programs, mentoring initiatives, bridge programs,
  or community partnerships
- Recruitment and retention: efforts to recruit and retain diverse
  students, faculty, and staff
- Advocacy: documented advocacy for institutional change, policy
  revision, or resource allocation that addresses inequity
- Community partnerships: sustained relationships with community
  organizations, schools, non-profits, or advocacy groups
- Professional organizations: service to disciplinary organizations that
  advances equity (e.g., AAA diversity initiatives, section leadership
  focused on inclusion)
- Public scholarship: writing, speaking, or media engagement that brings
  anthropological perspectives on equity to public audiences

## Integration with Scholarly Identity

The strongest diversity statements are not siloed -- they show DEI
engagement as integrated with the scholar's overall intellectual identity.
The research, teaching, and service contributions connect to each other
and to the scholar's broader scholarly commitments.

**Integration strategies:**

- **Show how research informs teaching:** "My fieldwork with immigrant
  communities directly shapes how I teach my course on migration and
  belonging -- students read community members' narratives alongside
  scholarly texts."
- **Show how teaching generates research questions:** "Student questions
  in my medical anthropology course about health disparities in our
  local community led me to develop a community-based research
  partnership with the county health department."
- **Show how service connects to research and teaching:** "My work on
  the department's curriculum committee was informed by my research on
  educational equity and resulted in a revised introductory sequence
  that better represents the diversity of anthropological thought."
- **Name the through-line:** Just as a research statement needs a
  connecting thread, a diversity statement benefits from an explicit
  statement of what integrates the scholar's DEI work across domains.

## Positionality: Brief, Honest, Purposeful

Many diversity statements include a positionality statement -- a brief
reflection on the scholar's own social position and how it shapes their
engagement with equity work. This can be effective but is also the most
commonly mishandled element of the diversity statement.

### Guidelines for Positionality

**Keep it brief.** 2-4 sentences. The positionality statement is context
for the actions that follow, not the centerpiece of the statement.

**Be honest.** Perform neither false modesty nor false suffering. If
the scholar holds privileged identities, acknowledge them without
excessive guilt. If the scholar holds marginalized identities, describe
how those experiences inform their work without making the statement a
personal narrative.

**Make it purposeful.** The positionality statement should set up the
evidence that follows. It should explain why the scholar does this work,
not serve as a stand-alone confession or credential.

**Avoid these traps:**

| Trap | What it looks like | Better approach |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| Centering self | Three paragraphs about personal identity journey before any evidence of action | 2-4 sentences of context, then move immediately to evidence |
| Identity as credential | "As a person of [identity], I understand diversity" | Describe what you do, not what you are. Identity informs action but does not substitute for it. |
| Guilt performance | Extended acknowledgment of privilege that reads as self-flagellation | Brief, honest acknowledgment followed by what the privilege-holder has done with their position |
| Tokenizing studied communities | "My research with [community] demonstrates my commitment to diversity" | Distinguish between studying communities and doing equity work. Show ethical research practices, not just topic choice. |
| Oversharing | Detailed personal narrative about formative experiences with difference | Keep it brief and professional. The committee needs to know what you do, not your life story. |

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

### Performative Diversity

The most common failure mode. The statement declares values, uses
institutional language, and signals alignment with DEI goals without
presenting evidence of action. Committees read dozens of these
statements; they recognize performative rhetoric immediately.

**Symptoms of performative diversity:**
- Heavy use of abstract language: "committed to," "believe in,"
  "passionate about," "dedicated to"
- No specific actions, programs, courses, or outcomes named
- DEI language that mirrors the institution's own website rather than
  the scholar's own practice
- The statement could be written by anyone in any field

**Cure:** Replace every value statement with an evidence statement. For
every sentence that begins "I believe..." ask: "What have I done that
demonstrates this belief?"

### Tokenizing Communities You Study

Anthropologists who study marginalized communities sometimes present
their research topic as evidence of diversity commitment. But studying
a community and serving it are different things. A scholar who does
extractive research on a marginalized community -- taking knowledge and
data without reciprocity -- is not doing diversity work, regardless of
the topic.

**How to avoid this:**
- Distinguish between the research topic and the research relationship.
  What does the community gain from the research?
- Describe reciprocal practices: community reports, shared authorship,
  capacity building, resource sharing
- Show how the research process itself is equitable, not just that the
  research is about inequality

### Treating Diversity as Compliance

Some statements read as though the author is checking a box required by
the institution. The tone is dutiful rather than engaged, and the content
is organized around institutional categories rather than the scholar's
own commitments.

**How to avoid this:**
- Write about what you actually care about and do, not what you think
  the committee wants to hear
- Organize around your own domains of engagement, not the institution's
  DEI framework
- Show genuine intellectual engagement with equity questions, not just
  procedural compliance

### Virtue Signaling Without Evidence

Closely related to performative diversity but more specific: the
statement makes strong moral claims about the importance of equity
without demonstrating that the scholar has done anything about it.

**Symptoms:**
- Strong declarative statements: "Diversity is central to everything
  I do"
- Moral framing: "As scholars, we have an obligation to..."
- No evidence connecting the moral commitment to specific practice

**Cure:** Every moral claim must be accompanied by an action. "Diversity
is central to my teaching" becomes "I redesigned my introductory course
to center Indigenous and Global South anthropological voices, replacing
70% of the previous reading list with texts by scholars from the
communities discussed."

## Structure: The Three-Part Diversity Statement

### Part 1: Positionality and Commitment (Brief Opening)

2-4 sentences establishing the scholar's position and why equity work
matters to their scholarly practice. This is context, not content. Move
quickly to evidence.

### Part 2: Evidence Across Domains (Core)

This is the body of the statement. Present evidence organized by domain
(research, teaching, service) or organized thematically across domains.
For each piece of evidence, use the Action-Evidence-Impact structure.

**Organization options:**

- **By domain:** Present research DEI contributions, then teaching, then
  service. Works well when the scholar has distinct activities in each
  domain.
- **By theme:** Organize around 2-3 themes that cut across domains (e.g.,
  "Mentoring underrepresented scholars," "Community-engaged research and
  teaching," "Curriculum transformation"). Works well when the scholar's
  DEI work is integrated and crosses boundaries.
- **By arc:** Past actions, current engagement, future plans. Works well
  when the scholar wants to show development over time.

### Part 3: Vision for Contribution (Closing)

Articulate what the scholar will contribute to DEI efforts at the target
institution. This section should be specific to the institution -- naming
programs, centers, communities, or initiatives the scholar would engage
with. Generic "I will continue my commitment" closings are weak.

---

## Addressing the "I Haven't Done Enough" Anxiety

Early-career scholars frequently worry that they lack sufficient DEI
experience to write a compelling statement. This anxiety is common and
usually unwarranted. The solution is developmental framing -- presenting
what the scholar has done at their career stage as genuine engagement,
while articulating a vision for growth.

### Strategies for Early-Career Scholars

- **Reframe modest contributions as genuine engagement.** Mentoring even one student from an underrepresented background is evidence. Revising a syllabus to include more diverse voices is evidence. Participating in a DEI workshop is evidence. Describe each honestly with its rationale and outcomes.
- **Use the developmental arc.** Past formative engagements, present actions (even if modest), future concrete plans that build on what you have done.
- **Be honest about where you are.** Committees do not expect postdocs to have founded programs. A honest, specific statement about modest contributions is far more compelling than an inflated statement about commitments that do not exist.
- **Name what you learned.** If you attended a workshop or training, describe what it taught you and how it changed your practice. Learning is itself evidence of engagement.

---

## Institutional Fit and Contribution Framing

The closing section of a diversity statement should demonstrate awareness
of the target institution's specific DEI context and articulate what the
scholar will contribute.

### What to Research About the Institution

- Institutional DEI strategic plan or framework
- Specific programs, centers, or initiatives related to equity
- Student demographics and campus climate
- Department-specific diversity efforts
- Community partnerships and local context
- Recent institutional events or changes related to DEI

### Framing Contributions

**Specific contributions are more compelling than general ones:**

Weak: "I look forward to contributing to the university's diversity
initiatives."

Strong: "I plan to develop a partnership between the Department of
Anthropology and the university's McNair Scholars Program, offering
undergraduate research mentoring in ethnographic methods for
first-generation and underrepresented students. This builds on my
experience mentoring McNair scholars at my current institution and
would complement the department's existing summer research program."

**Connect contributions to existing institutional efforts:**
- Show that you know what the institution is already doing
- Describe how your work complements or extends existing programs
- Avoid implying that the institution's current efforts are inadequate
  (even if they are)

---

## Navigating Political Context

Diversity statements exist in a politically charged landscape. Scholars
must write statements that are genuine and substantive while being aware
of the institutional and political dynamics surrounding DEI in higher
education.

### Writing Genuine Statements in Complex Contexts

- **Focus on evidence.** Evidence-based statements are more durable than ideological ones. Committees across the political spectrum can evaluate concrete actions and their outcomes.
- **Use precise language.** Avoid jargon that signals ideological alignment rather than describing practice. "I redesigned my course to include more diverse perspectives" is more precise than "I decolonized my syllabus" -- even if the latter is also accurate.
- **Ground claims in disciplinary values.** Anthropology's core commitments -- cross-cultural understanding, attention to inequality, respect for diverse knowledge systems -- provide a foundation that transcends political cycles.
- **Describe practices, not politics.** Committees evaluate actions, not affiliations.

### Institutional Variation

- **Public R1 universities:** Often have formal DEI requirements; statements may be evaluated by dedicated committees with specific rubrics.
- **SLACs:** Emphasize community-level engagement and the scholar's role in creating an inclusive campus culture.
- **Community colleges:** Access, equity, and student success are central to the mission; DEI engagement is framed in terms of student outcomes.
- **Research institutes:** DEI is framed in terms of equitable research practices, community engagement, and knowledge sharing.

Tailor the statement to the institution's context without being cynical. Write what is genuine, framed for the audience.
