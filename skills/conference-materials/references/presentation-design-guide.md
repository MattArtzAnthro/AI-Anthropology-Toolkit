## Slide Design Principles

### The Assertion-Evidence Model

The most effective academic slides use the assertion-evidence structure:

- **Slide title** = a full claim sentence (the assertion)
- **Slide body** = visual evidence supporting that claim (image, chart, diagram, quote)

This replaces the conventional topic-title model where slides are labeled with phrases
like "Background" or "Methods" and filled with bullet points.

| Conventional (Weak)                           | Assertion-Evidence (Strong)                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title: "Fieldwork Methods"                     | Title: "Fourteen months of participant observation revealed three distinct care practices" |
| Body: bullet list of methods                   | Body: photograph of field site + timeline graphic          |
| Title: "Results"                               | Title: "Healers reframed biomedical categories through ritual speech" |
| Body: paragraph of text                        | Body: transcription excerpt with highlighted speech acts   |
| Title: "Discussion"                            | Title: "These practices challenge the therapeutic sovereignty framework" |
| Body: more bullet points                       | Body: diagram showing framework revision                  |

### Slide Count and Pacing

The standard rule: 1 slide per minute of talk time.

| Talk Length   | Content Slides | Total (with title + conclusion) | Notes                        |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 10 minutes    | 8-10           | 10-12                          | Lightning-style, tight       |
| 15 minutes    | 12-15          | 14-17                          | Standard conference paper    |
| 20 minutes    | 16-20          | 18-22                          | Extended session             |
| 30 minutes    | 25-28          | 27-30                          | Keynote or invited talk      |
| 45-60 minutes | 35-50          | 37-52                          | Lecture or workshop          |

Adjust based on slide complexity:

- A slide with one image and a claim: 30-45 seconds
- A slide with a detailed chart or table: 60-90 seconds
- A slide with a key ethnographic excerpt: 60-90 seconds
- A transition or section-break slide: 15-30 seconds

### Text Limits and Visual Hierarchy

25-word maximum for slide body text (title sentence does not count). If you need more,
split across slides, replace text with visuals, or move detail to speaker notes.

| Tool              | How to Use                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Size              | Larger elements are seen first                              |
| Position          | Top-left is read first in left-to-right cultures            |
| Contrast          | High-contrast elements draw the eye                         |
| Color             | A single accent color highlights the key element            |
| White space       | Isolation draws attention to the surrounded element         |
| Weight            | Bold text reads before regular text                         |

### Color and Typography

**Typography rules:**

| Element           | Minimum Size | Recommended Font Type          |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Slide title       | 28pt         | Sans-serif (bold)              |
| Body text         | 24pt         | Sans-serif (regular)           |
| Captions/labels   | 18pt         | Sans-serif (regular or italic) |
| Footnotes/sources | 14pt         | Sans-serif (light)             |

Recommended sans-serif fonts: Calibri, Helvetica, Arial, Open Sans, Lato, Source Sans Pro.
Use a consistent 3-5 color palette. One accent color for emphasis. High contrast between
text and background. Avoid pure white backgrounds in dark rooms.

### Fieldwork Images

Use images as evidence, not decoration. Every image should support the slide's claim.
Caption with what the audience should notice. Use high-resolution (minimum 150 DPI).

**Consent:** Ensure consent for images of people and places. Blur identifying features
when needed. Note consent status in speaker notes. Be prepared to explain your consent
process during Q&A.

## Academic Poster Design

### The 2-Minute Scan Test

Design for three distances:

| Distance     | What Should Be Visible                                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10 feet      | Title and author names                                    |
| 6 feet       | Key finding or main argument (visual or headline)         |
| 3 feet       | Body text, figures, methods, and details                  |

### Layout Patterns

**3-column layout (most common):**

```
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
|                  TITLE AND AUTHORS                      |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
|                  |                  |                   |
|  Introduction    |  Key Findings    |  Implications     |
|                  |                  |                   |
|  Methods         |  Key Findings    |  Conclusion       |
|                  |  (continued)     |                   |
|                  |                  |  Contact / QR     |
+------------------+------------------+------------------+
```

Section order follows a Z-pattern (top-left to top-right, diagonal to bottom-left,
across to bottom-right): Introduction > Methods > Key Findings > Implications >
Conclusion > Contact/QR.

### Typography for Posters

| Element           | Font Size     | Notes                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Title             | 72pt or larger| Visible from 10 feet                     |
| Author names      | 48-56pt       | Below the title                          |
| Section headers   | 48pt          | Bold, clear hierarchy                    |
| Body text         | 36pt          | Never smaller than 28pt                  |
| Captions          | 28-32pt       | Below figures and images                 |
| References        | 24pt          | Minimal; full citations in a handout     |
| Contact info      | 24-28pt       | Bottom of poster                         |

### White Space, Figures, and Sizing

At least 30-40% of the poster should be white space. The poster is a conversation
starter, not a paper.

Figures: all labeled and captioned, high-resolution (minimum 300 DPI), alt text for
digital versions, limit 3-5 figures, readable from 3 feet.

| Standard Size  | Notes                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 48" x 36"     | Most common in North American conferences               |
| 42" x 36"     | Common alternative                                      |
| 36" x 48"     | Portrait orientation (less common)                      |
| A0 (33" x 47")| Common in European conferences                         |

Always check the conference specifications for poster board dimensions.

## Speaker Notes and Timing

### Notes as Prompts, Not Scripts

Notes should contain key phrases, transition sentences, exact quotes/data, timing cues,
and engagement reminders. Never write a verbatim script or duplicate slide content.

### Timing Cues

Mark timing checkpoints in your notes to stay on pace.

| Talk Length | Checkpoint Intervals | Example                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 10 minutes  | Every 2-3 minutes    | Slide 4: should be at 4:00                 |
| 15 minutes  | Every 5 minutes      | Slide 6: should be at 5:00; Slide 11: 10:00|
| 20 minutes  | Every 5 minutes      | Slide 6: 5:00; Slide 12: 10:00; Slide 17: 15:00 |

If you are behind at a checkpoint, identify which upcoming material can be summarized
in one sentence or skipped entirely.

### Transition Sentences

| Transition Type    | Example                                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Building           | "This finding becomes clearer when we turn to..."          |
| Contrasting        | "But this pattern does not hold in every context..."       |
| Deepening          | "To understand why, we need to look more closely at..."    |
| Shifting scale     | "Zooming out from this individual case..."                 |
| Returning          | "This brings us back to the question I opened with..."     |
| Complicating       | "However, this interpretation is complicated by..."        |

### The Opening Hook

The first 30 seconds of a talk set the tone. Effective hooks:

- **Fieldwork vignette**: a brief, vivid scene from your research
- **Puzzle**: an empirical or theoretical puzzle that your paper addresses
- **Provocative claim**: a surprising argument the audience wants to hear defended
- **Contradiction**: two things that should not coexist but do

Ineffective openings:

- Thanking the organizers at length
- Apologizing for anything (slides, nerves, time constraints)
- Defining a term from the dictionary
- Stating your outline ("First I will talk about X, then Y, then Z")

### The Closing Move

The last 30-60 seconds should return to the argument and its broader stakes:

- Return to the opening vignette or puzzle, now reframed by your argument
- State the contribution in one sentence
- Name the broader implications or questions your work opens up
- End on a claim, not on "thank you"

The final slide should display your key claim or a thought-provoking question, not a
"Thank You!" slide. Say thank you after the final intellectual point, not as the final
point itself.

### Adapting to Different Time Formats

| Situation              | Strategy                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 15 min cut to 10 min   | Cut one evidence section; compress context                |
| 20 min cut to 15 min   | Cut one evidence section; shorten opening and context     |
| Running 2 min over     | Skip your least essential evidence slide                  |
| Running 2 min under    | Expand the significance section; add a fieldwork anecdote |
| Time cut during session | Prioritize: opening hook, main argument, one evidence, closing |

## Oral Delivery Techniques

### Speaking Pace

| Pace                  | Words Per Minute | Use Case                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Slow (deliberate)     | 100-120          | Key claims, definitions, conclusions  |
| Conversational        | 120-150          | Most of the talk                      |
| Fast (energized)      | 150-170          | Brief context, setup, transitions     |

Vary your pace deliberately. Slow down for important claims. Speed up slightly for
background information. Pause after key statements to let them land.

### Pausing

Strategic pauses are the most underused delivery tool in academic talks. Pause after
stating your main argument, after a surprising finding, before a key claim, and during
transitions between major sections. A 2-3 second pause feels long to the speaker but
natural to the audience.

### Eye Contact and Room Engagement

- Look at the audience, not the screen or your notes
- Divide the room into three sections; rotate your attention among them
- Make brief eye contact with individuals (2-3 seconds), then move on
- In large rooms, look at the back row to project presence

### Managing Technology

**Before your talk:**

- Arrive early to test the projector, microphone, and your file
- Bring your presentation on a USB drive AND accessible via email/cloud
- Have a PDF backup in case your software does not work on the venue computer
- Check that embedded videos and audio play correctly

**If technology fails:** give the talk from notes. Narrate what the audience would have
seen. Never apologize more than once; move on and deliver the content.

### Handling Nervousness

| Strategy                  | When to Use                                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Practice aloud 3-5 times  | Starting one week before the conference              |
| Practice in front of someone | Two to three days before                          |
| Time yourself             | Every practice run                                   |
| Record yourself           | At least once, to catch verbal habits                |
| Arrive early              | Day of the talk; familiarize yourself with the room  |
| Breathe deliberately      | Immediately before you begin speaking                |
| Start with your hook      | The opening is rehearsed and comfortable             |

Nervousness decreases sharply after the first 60 seconds. Invest preparation energy in
the opening.

### Common Verbal Habits to Reduce

| Habit                 | Strategy                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Um" / "uh"          | Replace with a pause; silence is better than filler    |
| "Like"               | Practice without it; record yourself to hear frequency |
| "You know"           | Cut entirely; it adds nothing                          |
| "So, basically..."   | Start the sentence without the preamble                |
| "I think"            | State the claim directly; the audience knows it is yours |
| Upspeak (rising tone)| Practice declarative sentences with falling intonation  |
| Apologizing           | Stop saying sorry for your work; present with confidence |

### Reading the Room

- If the audience looks confused, slow down and rephrase your current point
- If heads are nodding, you can move faster through that material
- If people are on their phones, you have lost them; tell a story or ask a question
- If the chair signals time, jump to your conclusion slide
- Adapt in real time; a talk is a conversation, not a recording

---

## Q&A Preparation

### Anticipating Questions

Before your talk, prepare responses to 3-5 likely questions:

| Question Category    | Example                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Methods              | "How long were you in the field?" "How did you select participants?" |
| Scope                | "Does this apply to other regions?" "What about X population?" |
| Theory               | "How does this relate to [theorist]'s framework?"         |
| Comparison           | "How does your case compare to [other well-known case]?"  |
| Implications         | "What are the policy implications?" "What should practitioners do?" |
| Ethics               | "How did you handle consent?" "What did the community think?" |
| Pushback             | "But doesn't [counterexample] undermine your argument?"   |

### Handling Different Question Types

| Question Type               | Strategy                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Genuine curiosity           | Answer directly and concisely                                |
| Hostile or aggressive       | Restate neutrally; respond to intellectual content, not tone |
| Confused                    | Ask for clarification without condescension                  |
| Off-topic                   | Acknowledge briefly; redirect to your scope                  |
| Statement disguised as question | Acknowledge the point; respond briefly and move on       |

### The "I Don't Know" Response

"I don't know" is a valid and respected answer in academic Q&A. Follow it with:

- What you would need to investigate to answer the question
- Why the question is interesting and worth pursuing
- How it connects to your future research plans

"I do not have data on that, but it is an important question. To address it, I would
need to..."

### Redirecting Off-Topic Questions

1. Acknowledge the question is interesting
2. Note briefly that your data does not address it directly
3. Suggest where the answer might be found (another scholar, a different method)
4. Offer to continue the conversation after the session

## Accessibility

### Alt Text and Color Accessibility

Every image and figure needs alt text (photographs, charts, diagrams, maps). Enter alt
text in image properties of your presentation software.

**WCAG AA minimum contrast ratios:**

| Element               | Minimum Ratio | Notes                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Normal text           | 4.5:1         | Body text, captions                    |
| Large text (18pt+)    | 3:1           | Headers, titles                        |
| Graphical elements    | 3:1           | Chart lines, icons, borders            |

**Color-blind safe design:**

- Never encode meaning by color alone
- Use shape, pattern, or label in addition to color
- Avoid red-green combinations (the most common color vision deficiency)
- Use colorblind-safe palettes (many are available online)
- Test your slides with a color blindness simulator

### Font Accessibility

- Use sans-serif fonts for all projected text
- Avoid decorative, handwritten, or thin-weight fonts
- Minimum 24pt for body text on slides; 36pt for posters
- Use bold for emphasis, not italics (italics are harder to read at a distance)
- Ensure adequate spacing between lines (1.2-1.5 line height)

### Transitions and Accessible Versions

- Avoid distracting animations (spinning, bouncing, flying text)
- Use simple transitions (fade, cut) or no transitions
- Never use transitions that flash or strobe
- Share slides electronically before or after the talk (with alt text intact)
- Provide a text-based handout for audience members using screen readers
- If your talk includes audio or video, provide captions or a transcript

## Narrative Arc for Conference Talks

### The Five-Part Structure

A well-structured 15-20 minute talk follows a narrative arc, not a report structure.

| Part                              | Content                                                   | Time (15 min) |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1. Opening hook + research puzzle | Fieldwork vignette, puzzle, or provocation; state question| 2 min         |
| 2. Context                        | Field site, literature, theoretical framing, methods      | 3 min         |
| 3. Evidence and analysis          | 2-3 analytical moves, each grounded in evidence           | 7-8 min       |
| 4. Contribution                   | What this changes for the field; future questions         | 2 min         |
| 5. Closing                        | Return to opening; restate argument; broader stakes       | 1 min         |

**Structure for each analytical move:**

1. State the analytical claim (what this evidence shows)
2. Present the evidence (ethnographic scene, data, artifact, transcript)
3. Analyze the evidence (what it means, how it supports the argument)

Two to three well-developed analytical moves are more effective than five rushed ones.
The context section serves the argument — include only what is necessary for the audience
to follow your analytical moves.

### Timing Template

| Part                     | Minutes (15-min talk) | Minutes (20-min talk) | Slides       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| Opening hook + puzzle    | 2                     | 2-3                   | 1-2          |
| Context                  | 3                     | 3-4                   | 2-3          |
| Evidence move 1          | 3                     | 3-4                   | 2-3          |
| Evidence move 2          | 3                     | 3-4                   | 2-3          |
| Evidence move 3          | --                    | 2-3                   | 0 or 2-3     |
| Contribution             | 2                     | 2-3                   | 1-2          |
| Closing                  | 1                     | 1                     | 1            |
| Buffer                   | 1                     | 1-2                   | --           |

Always include a 1-2 minute buffer. If you plan exactly 15 minutes of content for a
15-minute slot, you will run over.
