# Conference Abstract Writing Guide

Reference for writing conference abstracts in anthropology. Covers argument structure,
format requirements, abstract types, and subfield conventions.

## Abstract Architecture: Argument-Evidence-Contribution

### The Contribution Statement

The single most important sentence in any abstract is the contribution statement. It
must make a claim, not describe an activity.

| Weak (Descriptive)                                | Strong (Argumentative)                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "This paper examines kinship in urban Brazil."    | "This paper argues that urban kinship in Brazil reconfigures..."    |
| "This paper explores digital labor practices."    | "This paper demonstrates that digital labor practices reveal..."    |
| "This paper looks at healing rituals among..."    | "This paper shows how healing rituals among X produce..."           |
| "This paper discusses the role of migration..."   | "This paper argues that migration fundamentally reshapes..."        |
| "This paper considers food sovereignty..."        | "This paper contends that food sovereignty movements challenge..."  |

Key verbs for contribution statements:

- argues, contends, demonstrates, shows, reveals
- challenges, complicates, extends, reframes
- offers, proposes, theorizes, advances

Verbs to avoid in the contribution statement:

- examines, explores, looks at, considers, discusses
- investigates, surveys, reviews, addresses

These descriptive verbs belong in the methods sentence, not the opening claim. They
describe activity, not argument.

### The Three-Move Structure

Every effective abstract performs three moves, regardless of length:

**Move 1 — What you argue (the claim)**

State the paper's central argument in one to two sentences.

**Move 2 — What evidence supports it (the basis)**

In two to three sentences, describe the evidence, methods, and material that ground the
argument. Be specific: name the site, the population, the time frame, the data type.

**Move 3 — Why it matters (the significance)**

In one to two sentences, connect the argument to broader scholarly conversations,
theoretical debates, or real-world implications.

### Opening With the Scholarly Conversation

The first one to two sentences should situate the paper within an ongoing scholarly
conversation. Effective openings:

- Name a tension or debate in the field
- Identify a gap that the paper addresses
- Point to an empirical puzzle that existing frameworks cannot explain
- Reference a shared assumption the paper challenges

Ineffective openings:

- Broad truisms ("Globalization has transformed...")
- Dictionary definitions ("According to Merriam-Webster...")
- Rhetorical questions without stakes ("What does it mean to be human?")
- Personal narratives without analytical framing

### Closing With Significance

The final sentence or two should answer the "so what?" question. Effective closings:

- Connect findings to a broader theoretical conversation
- Name the implications for policy, practice, or public understanding
- Identify what the findings open up for future research
- Articulate how the paper shifts or reframes an existing debate

## Format Requirements by Conference

Always check the current year's call for papers, as requirements change.

### AAA (American Anthropological Association)

| Abstract Type         | Word Limit   | Notes                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Individual paper      | 250 words    | For open calls or pre-organized sessions           |
| Organized session     | 300-500 words| Session rationale (separate from individual papers)|
| Individual (in panel) | 250 words    | Each panelist submits their own abstract            |
| Roundtable            | 250 words    | Session-level abstract; individuals may not need one|
| Poster                | 250 words    | Same as individual paper                           |

Additional AAA notes: session organizers must submit the session abstract separately.
Individual abstracts within an organized session are submitted by each author. Check
whether your section has specific additional requirements.

### Regional Associations

| Association | Typical Limit | Notes                                        |

| ALLA        | 250 words     | American Library Association (anthro panels) |

### International Conferences

| Conference  | Typical Limit | Notes                                        |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| IUAES       | 250-300 words | International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences |
| EASA        | 250-300 words | European Association of Social Anthropologists|
| JASCA       | 250 words     | Japanese Society of Cultural Anthropology    |

| LASA        | 250 words     | Latin American Studies Association           |

### Interdisciplinary Conferences

| Type                        | Typical Limit | Notes                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| STS/Science Studies         | 300-500 words | More methodological framing needed     |
| Medical/Global Health       | 300-500 words | Often structured (background, methods, results, conclusions) |
| Environmental/Climate       | 300-500 words | Policy relevance is often expected     |
| Digital Humanities          | 300-500 words | Technical methods need explanation      |
| Area Studies                | 250-300 words | Regional expertise assumed             |

For interdisciplinary audiences, budget extra words for explaining anthropological methods,
defining discipline-specific terms, and connecting to the other field's questions.

## Abstract Types

### 1. Individual Paper Abstract

The most common type. A single paper submitted to an open call or a pre-organized
session.

Structure: scholarly context (1-2 sentences) > contribution statement (1-2 sentences) >
evidence and methods (2-3 sentences) > significance (1-2 sentences).

Tips:

- Front-load the argument; do not bury it at the end
- Be specific about methods and evidence (name the site, the data, the approach)
- Avoid jargon that only your subfield will understand
- Every sentence should earn its place; at 250 words, there is no room for filler

### 2. Organized Session / Panel Proposal

Session rationale structure: the intellectual problem uniting the panel (2-3 sentences) >
how papers collectively address it (3-4 sentences) > what the session contributes to the
field (2-3 sentences) > how the discussant will synthesize (1-2 sentences).

Key: not "these papers are all about X" but "together, these papers reveal Y about X."

Common mistakes in session rationales:

- Listing topics instead of articulating a shared problem
- Failing to explain why these specific papers belong together
- Not giving the discussant a clear intellectual task

### 3. Roundtable Abstract

Frame questions rather than findings. Indicate productive tensions the roundtable will
explore. Name participants and their expertise briefly. Suggest what the audience will
gain from attending. Typically shorter and more open-ended than panel abstracts.

### 4. Poster Session Abstract

Poster abstracts emphasize methods and findings more concretely than paper abstracts.

Structure: research question (1-2 sentences) > methods and data (2-3 sentences) > key
findings (2-3 sentences) > implications (1-2 sentences). Be concrete about findings;
posters reward specificity. Mention visual elements if relevant (maps, charts, images).

### 5. Workshop Proposal

Workshop proposals emphasize what participants will learn or do, not what the organizer
has found.

Structure: topic and rationale (2-3 sentences) > learning objectives (2-3 sentences) >
format and activities (2-3 sentences) > who should attend (1-2 sentences). Emphasize
interactivity. Note required materials or preparation. Indicate ideal and maximum
number of participants.

### 6. Lightning Talk

State one main finding, provocation, or question. Minimal context. Signal what makes
the finding surprising or generative. Abstracts are often 100-150 words. Every word
must justify its presence.

## Organized Session Strategy

### Assembling a Panel

**Diversity that strengthens a panel:**

| Dimension             | Why It Matters                                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Methods               | Shows the problem from multiple angles                      |
| Field sites / regions | Demonstrates that the argument is not site-specific         |
| Career stage          | Brings different perspectives and signals mentorship        |
| Subfield              | Crosses internal boundaries and attracts wider audience     |
| Theoretical tradition | Creates productive tension rather than echo chamber         |
| Institutional variety | Shows the question has broad disciplinary relevance         |

**What to avoid:**

- All papers from the same lab, cohort, or advisor (looks insular)
- All papers using the same method in the same region (too narrow)
- Papers that do not speak to each other (a loose collection, not a panel)

### Session Titles

| Weak                                      | Stronger                                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| "New Perspectives on Migration"           | "Borders After the Border: Migration and State Power"  |
| "Thinking About AI"                       | "Algorithms in the Field: AI and Ethnographic Method"  |
| "Health and Healing"                      | "Therapeutic Sovereignties: Who Decides What Heals?"   |
| "Climate Change and Culture"              | "Living With Ruin: Cultural Responses to Climate Collapse"|

Good session titles:

- Name the intellectual stakes (not just the topic)
- Use a colon structure: evocative phrase + analytical subtitle
- Signal the disciplinary conversation the session enters
- Are searchable and legible to someone scanning the program

### Discussant Framing

When proposing a session, explain what the discussant will do:

- What productive tensions across the papers should the discussant highlight?
- What overarching questions should the discussant pose to the panel?
- Should the discussant connect the papers to a broader literature?
- Should the discussant raise methodological or ethical questions?

A good discussant framing prevents the discussant from simply summarizing each paper.

## Subfield-Specific Abstract Conventions

| Subfield                    | Expected Elements                          | Key Conventions                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cultural anthropology       | Theoretical framing + ethnographic case    | Theory frames ethnography; name site and population; engage current debates |
| Archaeology                 | Research question + methods + findings     | Name techniques and datasets; specific findings (dates, quantities, spatial patterns) |
| Linguistic anthropology     | Data type + analysis + significance        | Name analytical framework (CA, indexicality, etc.) and language(s); connect micro to macro |
| Biological/physical anthro  | Hypothesis + data + results + implications | Hypothesis-driven; reproducible methods; summarize stats (sample size, significance) |
| Medical anthropology        | Problem + approach + findings + relevance  | Bridge clinical and anthropological vocabularies; note policy implications |
| Applied anthropology        | Problem + methods + outcomes + impact      | Name stakeholders and community partners; emphasize practical outcomes |

**Cultural anthropology structure:** theory > site/methods > argument > contribution

**Archaeology structure:** question > site/materials/methods > results > interpretation

**Linguistic anthropology structure:** phenomenon > data > analysis > broader significance

**Biological anthropology structure:** hypothesis > sample/methods > results > implications

**Medical anthropology structure:** health context > methods > findings > policy relevance

**Applied anthropology structure:** problem > engagement methods > outcomes > impact

## Abstract Failure Modes

Common reasons abstracts are rejected or weakened, and how to prevent them.

| Failure Mode                        | Description                                                        | Prevention                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Topic without argument              | Describes what the paper is about but not what it claims           | Start with "This paper argues that..." and test the claim       |
| Buried argument                     | The argument appears in the last sentence instead of the first     | Front-load the contribution statement                           |
| Methodological vagueness            | "Based on ethnographic fieldwork" with no specifics                | Name the site, duration, data types, and analytical approach    |
| Jargon overload                     | Assumes the reader knows your subfield's vocabulary                | Have someone outside your subfield read the abstract            |
| Overpromising                       | Claims the paper will "transform" or "revolutionize" the field     | Use precise verbs: complicates, extends, reframes, challenges   |
| Underpromising                      | "This paper offers a preliminary exploration of..."                | Name a concrete contribution, even if modest                    |
| Scope creep                         | Tries to cover too much in 250 words                               | One argument, one body of evidence, one contribution            |
| No scholarly conversation           | Paper exists in a vacuum with no connection to existing work       | Name the debate, gap, or tension the paper addresses            |
| Missing significance                | Stops at findings without explaining why they matter               | Always answer "so what?" in the final sentence                  |
| Generic closing                     | "This paper contributes to our understanding of..."               | Be specific about what understanding changes and how            |
| Wrong register                      | Too casual or too dense for the audience                           | Match the tone of the conference and the session                |
| Passive voice overuse               | "It was found that..." throughout                                  | Use active voice: "I argue," "this paper shows," "the data reveal" |
| No connection to session theme      | Abstract does not reference the organized session's framing        | Echo session keywords and connect your argument to the session  |
| Listing instead of arguing          | "First I will discuss X, then I will discuss Y"                    | Replace listing with analytical claims                          |

---

## Keyword Selection

Keywords serve two functions: they help program committees place your paper in the right
session, and they help attendees find your paper in the program. Match keywords to
session themes, searchability, and disciplinary vocabulary.

| Category         | Examples                                                        |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Subfield         | medical anthropology, linguistic anthropology, archaeology      |
| Method           | ethnography, participant observation, excavation, corpus analysis|
| Theory           | political ecology, affect theory, practice theory, assemblage   |
| Region           | South Asia, Amazonia, urban United States, Pacific Islands      |
| Topic            | migration, kinship, food, health, technology, ritual            |
| Population       | Indigenous communities, refugees, health workers, youth         |
| Theme            | sovereignty, temporality, infrastructure, care, labor           |

**Strategy:** Use 3-5 keywords. Mix broad and specific terms. Include at least one that
matches a conference track or session theme. Avoid overly idiosyncratic terms that only
your project uses. Check what keywords successful papers in your area have used in past
programs.

## Adapting Abstracts Across Contexts

### Rewriting for Different Audiences

The same research may need different abstracts for different conferences. Key adjustments:

| From                      | To                         | What Changes                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Discipline conference     | Interdisciplinary          | Add methodological context; define terms; more framing |
| Domestic conference       | International              | Add regional context; less assumed familiarity         |
| Individual paper          | Organized session paper    | Add connection to session theme; echo session framing  |
| Paper abstract            | Poster abstract            | More concrete methods and findings; less theory        |
| Full conference paper     | Lightning talk             | One claim only; strip to essentials                    |

### Repurposing and Versioning

Keep a running document of abstract versions. When adapting:

- Start from the contribution statement (it should remain stable)
- Adjust framing and context for the new audience
- Check word limits before drafting (do not cut from a longer version carelessly)
- Update keywords to match the new conference's vocabulary

---

## Writing Process

### Drafting Sequence

1. Write the contribution statement first (one sentence)
2. Write the evidence/methods paragraph (what grounds the claim)
3. Write the significance statement (why it matters)
4. Write the opening (what conversation you enter)
5. Revise for word count, cutting from the middle
6. Read aloud to check flow and clarity

### Revision Checklist

- [ ] Does the first sentence or two situate the paper in a scholarly conversation?
- [ ] Is there a clear contribution statement with an argumentative verb?
- [ ] Are methods and evidence specific (site, data, approach)?
- [ ] Does the abstract answer "so what?" by the end?
- [ ] Is the abstract within the word limit?
- [ ] Are keywords well chosen and strategically selected?
- [ ] Has someone outside the immediate subfield read it for clarity?
- [ ] Does it connect to the session theme (if submitting to an organized panel)?
- [ ] Is the tone appropriate for the conference?
- [ ] Are there any sentences that could be cut without losing meaning?

### Common Word-Count Traps

When you need to cut words:

- Remove throat-clearing openings ("It is well established that...")
- Compress relative clauses ("the community that I studied" becomes "the community")
- Eliminate redundant phrases ("in order to" becomes "to")
- Cut hedging language ("it seems that," "it appears," "perhaps")
- Remove unnecessary qualifiers ("very," "quite," "rather")
- Combine sentences that make related points

## Quick Reference: Abstract Template

```
[1-2 sentences: Scholarly conversation / problem / gap]

This paper argues that [CLAIM]. Drawing on [METHODS: e.g., 14 months of ethnographic
fieldwork in LOCATION / analysis of N artifacts from SITE / corpus of N hours of
recorded interaction], I show that [EVIDENCE-BASED ELABORATION OF CLAIM].

[1-2 sentences: Further development of the argument, additional evidence or analytical
moves]

[1-2 sentences: Significance — why this matters for the field, for theory, for practice,
or for the communities involved]
```

This template works for 200-300 word abstracts. For longer interdisciplinary abstracts,
expand the methods and significance sections. For poster abstracts, give more weight to
methods and concrete findings. For roundtable proposals, replace the methods section with
questions for discussion.
