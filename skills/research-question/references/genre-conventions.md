# Genre Conventions for Research Questions

This reference covers how research questions should be framed, placed, and
formatted across the major genres anthropologists write in. The same
intellectual problem needs different rhetorical packaging depending on where
it appears.

## Journal Articles

### General Principles

Journal editors and reviewers see titles, abstracts, and introductions first —
often only those elements. The research question must be legible in that front
matter without specialized local shorthand.

Key conventions in major sociocultural anthropology journals:

- The theoretical problem must be clear early in the introduction. Avoid
  splitting "theory at the beginning and end" from "data in the middle."
  Instead, repeatedly connect ethnographic sections back to the governing
  problem throughout the article.

- Discourage rigid IMRaD structure for sociocultural anthropology. Build the
  article around the interrelation of ideas. Consider whether a "road map"
  paragraph is needed — sometimes it helps, sometimes it's mechanical.

- Avoid first-person metadiscursive frames: "I argue," "in this article, I
  describe," "this paper explores." State the analysis directly. This has
  knock-on effects for question phrasing: questions should be direct
  analytical claims, not announcements of what you plan to do.

- Titles should be intelligible beyond the discipline, include searchable
  terms, and carry both the phenomenon and the conceptual lever when
  possible.

- Keywords should enhance discoverability, not replicate the title.

### Word Limits and Their Implications

Word limits bound how many sub-questions a single article can responsibly
answer. Typical limits for major journals:

- American Anthropologist: 8,000 words (initial submissions, inclusive of
  figures, references, and notes with specified exclusions)
- American Ethnologist: 7,500–11,000 words
- Cultural Anthropology: similar range
- JRAI: typically 8,000–10,000 words

Within these limits, most articles can responsibly address one governing
question plus 2–3 sub-questions. If your question set requires more, you
have a dissertation, not an article.

### Placement

- **Title + subtitle**: Carries phenomenon and conceptual lever. Designed for
  discoverability and cross-disciplinary intelligibility.
- **Abstract**: States governing problem, empirical setting, core analytic
  move, and contribution. Often what is sent to potential reviewers.
- **Introduction**: Makes the theoretical problem clear early. Signals the
  question set explicitly (one paragraph) or implicitly via problem-framing.
  Minimal self-referential metadiscourse.
- **Body sections**: Organized around ideas and their interrelation, not
  necessarily by method or data type. Periodic callbacks to the governing
  problem.
- **Conclusion**: Echoes and extends the governing question. States what was
  learned, what it contributes, and what remains.

### AI Disclosure

Some journals now require disclosure of AI-generated text or images in
acknowledgments. This is a compliance requirement, not an intellectual one,
but it means the question set and its framing should be genuinely the
researcher's intellectual work, with AI assistance disclosed as such.

## Dissertation Proposals

### General Principles

Proposals treat the research question as the hub that links theory, data,
method, and feasibility. The question section is evaluated not only for
intellectual quality but also for demonstrating that the researcher can
articulate what they are doing, why, and how.

### Typical Structure

The most robust layout across institutional templates:

1. **Project Statement and Research Questions** — first, because it guides
   everything else. Questions are explicitly enumerated, not buried in prose.
2. **Literature Review** — selective and explicitly tied to the question's
   conceptual lever. Not a comprehensive survey; a targeted argument for why
   these questions matter given the state of the field.
3. **Methods and Analysis Plan** — maps each research question to data types,
   tools, skills, and permissions needed.
4. **Feasibility Plan** — with a contingency pathway when relevant.
5. **Ethics Section** — treats ethics as relational and historically situated,
   not solely as compliance.

### Question Set Conventions

- Commonly 3–7 questions, often hierarchical (governing + subsidiary).
- Each question must map cleanly to data types, skills, permissions, and a
  work plan.
- Include both "what" questions (empirical) and "how" questions (analytical /
  processual).
- For three-article dissertations: questions should be partitioned into
  publishable units that can stand alone but share a conceptual lever.

### Committee Expectations

Committees evaluate questions for:
- Clarity and specificity (can the committee member understand what will be
  studied?)
- Doability (can this person do this work in the available time with the
  available resources?)
- Contribution (will the answers to these questions matter to the field?)
- Methodological coherence (do the methods match the questions?)
- Ethical adequacy (have risks been thought through?)

## Grant Applications

### Wenner-Gren Dissertation Fieldwork Grant

Key conventions that shape question framing:
- Expects the governing question to be the intellectual hook in the project
  description.
- Explicitly asks applicants to treat ethics broadly, beyond immediate
  participant risk and anonymization. Include obligations to descendants
  and local stakeholders.
- Explicitly asks for a "Plan B" — a contingency that still addresses the
  research questions if conditions change dramatically.
- Values questions that demonstrate the researcher understands the
  difference between "what I will study" and "what I will contribute to
  the discipline."

### NSF Cultural Anthropology (BCS-CA)

Key conventions:
- Research questions must demonstrate "intellectual merit" (contribution to
  scientific knowledge) and "broader impacts" (benefit to society).
- Questions should be phrased to show how the project advances theoretical
  understanding, not merely documents a situation.
- Methods should be clearly mapped to questions, with a realistic timeline.
- NSF reviewers expect explicit attention to data management and sharing.

### Fulbright

Key conventions:
- Questions should demonstrate knowledge of the host country context and
  why the research must be conducted there.
- Emphasizes "mutual understanding" — questions should imply bilateral
  benefit, not extractive knowledge production.
- Shorter format demands a highly compressed question set (often 1
  governing question with 2 sub-questions maximum).

### General Grant-Writing Principles for Questions

- Lead with the most compelling question, not the broadest.
- Map sub-questions to timeline milestones — reviewers want to see that
  months 1–6 address questions 1–2, months 7–12 address questions 3–4, etc.
- Budget and questions should be coherent — if the question requires
  multi-sited work, the budget should reflect travel between sites.
- "Broader impacts" or "societal relevance" sections should flow naturally
  from the question set, not feel tacked on.

## MA Thesis Proposals

### Key Differences from Dissertations

- Shorter timeline demands more bounded questions.
- Typically 1–3 questions, not a full hierarchical set.
- Questions must imply expected finding types — committees want to know the
  student can complete the project.
- Abstracts often require: clearly defined research question, relevance,
  how it will be examined, and expected findings or broader impacts — all
  compressed into 150–250 words.

## Applied and Consulting Proposals

### Key Differences from Academic Genres

- Lead with the problem the client or stakeholder cares about, not with the
  theoretical intervention.
- Research questions may be framed as "inquiry questions" or "evaluation
  questions" depending on the organizational context.
- Translate academic framing into actionable inquiry: "How do employees
  negotiate competing demands..." becomes "What workplace conditions enable
  or hinder the adoption of the new protocol?"
- Maintain analytical depth without academic register. The question should
  still have a conceptual lever, but it may be implicit rather than
  foregrounded.
- Include stakeholder definitions of the problem alongside the researcher's
  framing — applied questions are co-constructed.
- Harm-minimization language is especially important: applied research
  findings can directly affect people's employment, services, or policy
  environment.

## Cross-Genre Adaptation Checklist

When adapting a research question from one genre to another:

| From → To | Key adjustment |
|-----------|----------------|
| Dissertation → Article | Scope down to one governing question + 2–3 sub-questions. Kill sub-questions that don't fit the word limit. |
| Dissertation → Grant | Lead with intellectual hook. Map questions to timeline and budget. Add contingency / Plan B language. |
| Article → Public engagement | Translate the governing question into plain language. The conceptual lever becomes "why this matters" in everyday terms. |
| Academic → Applied | Replace theoretical vocabulary with problem-oriented language. Keep the analytical structure but change the surface register. |
| Grant → Dissertation | Expand. Add sub-questions that were compressed out for the grant format. Restore full theoretical apparatus. |
