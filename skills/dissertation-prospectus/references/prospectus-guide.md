# Dissertation Proposal / Prospectus

Reference file for generating anthropology dissertation proposals and prospectuses.
Loaded by the research-design-planning domain SKILL.md when the user is writing
a dissertation prospectus, dissertation proposal, upgrade document, transfer
document, or fieldwork clearance proposal.

## What This Document Is

A dissertation proposal (US: "prospectus"; UK: "upgrade proposal," "transfer
document," or "fieldwork proposal") is a gatekeeping document with two
simultaneous audiences: the supervisory committee (who prioritize intellectual
coherence and feasibility) and external evaluators such as funders, ethics
boards, and access gatekeepers (who prioritize compliance, risk mitigation,
and credible execution). The strongest proposals are modular — they can be
adapted with minor revision into a committee prospectus, a fundable grant
narrative, and an ethics/risk dossier rather than requiring full rewrites for
each context.

---

## Before You Begin: Gather Context

Ask the user for these inputs before generating any content. Do not assume
defaults without confirmation.

### Required context

1. **Program and milestone.** Which institution? Which milestone (US qualifying
   exam prospectus, UK upgrade/transfer, UK fieldwork clearance, other)? This
   determines length norms, required components, and evaluation criteria.
2. **Research topic and site(s).** What is the project about and where will
   fieldwork occur?
3. **Epistemic stance.** Which of the shared parameter stances does the
   researcher work within? (See DESIGN.md for the full list of 42 stances.)
   Most researchers combine stances — ask which is primary and which are
   secondary.
4. **Target funder (if dual-purpose).** Is this prospectus also serving as the
   basis for an NSF DDRIG, Wenner-Gren, Fulbright, or other application? If
   so, load the relevant funder reference file alongside this one, because the
   prospectus will need to satisfy both committee and funder requirements
   simultaneously.
5. **Stage of development.** Is the user starting from scratch, refining an
   existing draft, or adapting a prospectus into a different format?

### Helpful but not required

- Theoretical framework or key theorists the user is engaging
- Preliminary fieldwork or pilot data
- Language competencies relevant to the field site
- Committee composition and known preferences
- Timeline constraints (when is the defense/viva/clearance interview?)

## Length and Format Norms by Region

Length varies significantly by institution and milestone. Use these as
defaults, but always defer to the user's program-specific requirements.

### United States

| Context | Typical length | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Short committee prospectus (e.g., Berkeley sociocultural) | 8–10 pages | Explicitly grant-narrative compatible; submitted at qualifying exam |
| Biological / archaeological prospectus (e.g., Berkeley bio anth) | ≤8 pages | Higher density of design specifics required |
| Full committee prospectus (e.g., Harvard social anthropology) | ~25–30 double-spaced pages, excluding bibliography | Defended before prospectus committee |
| Harvard archaeology prospectus | ~20 double-spaced pages, excluding bibliography | Formal defense |

US prospectuses are typically tied to qualifying exams or candidacy advancement.
The prospectus defense usually occurs in the third year (and no later than end
of the seventh enrolled term at Harvard). Berkeley frames normative progress as
advancement to candidacy by the end of the third year.

### United Kingdom

| Context | Typical length | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| LSE MRes/PhD upgrade proposal | 10,000 words | Viva included; proposal is 50% of MRes year assessment |
| Cambridge fieldwork proposal | ≤7,000 words (footnotes included, bibliography excluded) | Plus separate risk assessment form; clearance interview with PhD committee |
| Oxford transfer of status | ≤20,000 words total submission (including proposal) | Assessor interview; must demonstrate viability for completion in 3–4 years |
| Oxford confirmation of status | ≤20,000 words (outline ≤4,000 + chapters ≤20,000) | Late-stage validation; near-complete thesis plan required |

UK progression is more explicitly procedural and compliance-linked, pairing
proposal writing with risk assessment, ethics training, and formal viva-style
reviews. Ethics clearance is often integrated into the proposal workflow itself
rather than handled separately.

## Section Structure and Proportional Allocation

The following template is a practical synthesis, not an institutional mandate.
Adapt section order, headings, and proportions to the user's specific program
requirements. The key principle: every section should be present in some form,
even if combined or reordered.

| Section | Share of total length | What it must accomplish |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Title + Abstract** | 150–250 words | Compress the entire argument. Wenner-Gren caps abstracts at 200 words. |
| **Problem statement, significance, contribution** | 15–20% | Frame the intellectual puzzle. Why does this matter? What is at stake theoretically? |
| **Research questions** (and hypotheses if appropriate) | 5–10% | Articulate 2–4 fieldwork-operational questions plus the theoretical claim they address. |
| **Theoretical positioning** | 10–15% | Show what conceptual work becomes possible because of this case, site, or data. Theory as leverage, not allegiance. |
| **Literature review** (theoretical + ethnographic/area) | 15–25% | Demonstrably selective, problem-centered. Show command of the terrain without attempting exhaustive coverage. |
| **Research design and methods** | 25–35% | The largest section. Specify evidence, justify site-method pairing, show how analysis proceeds. |
| **Data management + analysis plan** | 5–10% | Specify coding approach, triangulation strategy, and what constitutes an analytic claim. |
| **Ethics, consent, and access** | 5–10% | Beyond minimal compliance. Address consent modalities, community obligations, data protection. |
| **Timeline and feasibility** | 3–7% (US) / 5–10% (UK) | Include pre-fieldwork workstreams (language, affiliations, ethics clearance, pilot contacts). |
| **Budget and funding plan** | 3–7% (US) / 5–10% (UK) | Credible, itemized, aligned with the evidence plan. |
| **Bibliography** | As needed (3–10 pages typical) | Selective, problem-centered, citing works actually engaged. Wenner-Gren caps at 10 pages. |

### Section flow logic

```
Title + Abstract
  → Problem + Stakes (why this matters)
    → Research Questions (what you will ask/observe/trace)
      → Theoretical Positioning (what conceptual work this enables)
        → Literature Review (theoretical + ethnographic/area context)
          → Research Design + Methods (how you will generate evidence)
            → Ethics + Consent + Access + Risk
            → Data Management + Analysis Plan
              → Timeline + Feasibility
                → Budget + Funding Plan
                  → Bibliography

## Guidance by Section

### Problem Statement and Significance

The problem statement does three things simultaneously: (1) identifies an
empirical puzzle or gap, (2) explains why that puzzle matters theoretically,
and (3) positions the proposed research as capable of addressing it.

Avoid framing the problem as "X has not been studied." The absence of prior
research is not itself a problem — the question is what understanding is lost
because of that absence and what the proposed research will make visible.

For the epistemic stance the user has identified, connect the problem to the
theoretical concerns that stance foregrounds. An interpretivist framing
highlights meaning-making gaps; a critical framing highlights power dynamics
or structural conditions that remain unexamined; a decolonial framing might
foreground whose knowledge has been excluded from existing accounts.

### Research Questions

Treat research questions as a design interface between theory and evidence.
The strongest proposals use "dual articulation": (1) a small number of
fieldwork-operational questions (what you will ask, observe, trace, or
sample), and (2) an explicitly theorized claim about how answering those
questions will revise or adjudicate a broader conceptual debate.

**Important audience calibration:** NSF's Cultural Anthropology DDRIG
solicitation explicitly requires empirically driven questions or hypotheses
subject to falsification through data collection and analysis. Proposals
oriented primarily to applied policy or descriptive work without
theory-testing/expanding contribution may be returned without review. If the
user is writing for NSF, frame questions with falsifiable stakes even when
the underlying methods are qualitative. For committee-only prospectuses,
more interpretive framing is usually acceptable.

Wenner-Gren warns against presenting answers as already known and criticizes
proposals claiming to answer many questions without convincingly addressing
any single one thoroughly. Two to four well-articulated questions are
stronger than six to eight vague ones.

### Theoretical Positioning

Theory is evaluated as leverage, not allegiance: what conceptual work becomes
possible because of this case, site, or data form? Avoid presenting theory
as a loyalty statement ("I use practice theory"). Instead, show what the
theoretical framework makes visible about your empirical material and what
analytical moves it enables.

NSF explicitly recommends a labeled "intellectual merit" section highlighting
scientific generalizability. Cambridge requires showing how macro frameworks
and local histories, linguistic conditions, and power relations shape what
can be known through fieldwork. Oxford's transfer criteria emphasize evidence
of wide reading and critical analysis.

Connect theory to methods: the theoretical framework should motivate specific
methodological choices. If the user works within STS, the methods should
reflect attention to material-semiotic assemblages. If the framework is
phenomenological, the methods should prioritize first-person experience and
embodied encounters.

### Literature Review

The current norm is demonstrably selective, problem-centered, and
multi-tradition where relevant. The literature review is not a comprehensive
survey — it is a strategic argument about where the proposed research sits
within existing conversations and what it adds.

Three moves to make:
1. Show command of the theoretical terrain the project engages.
2. Show familiarity with ethnographic and area-specific literature on the
   site/region/population.
3. Identify the specific gap, tension, or unresolved debate that the
   proposed research addresses.

Cambridge explicitly requires both theoretical and ethnographic literature
plus regional context (history, economy, languages). Wenner-Gren instructs
applicants to cite literature linked to approach, context, methods, and
ethics. NSF rejects literature reviews that merely list areas of scholarship
without showing how theory is tested, queried, or advanced.

Reviewers may look for awareness of essential literature in other languages
or in approaches that disagree with the applicant's own stance. The
bibliography should be selective rather than indiscriminate but should
demonstrate range.

Cambridge recommends an annotated working bibliography distinguishing between
works already read and not yet read — a useful format for committee
prospectuses even when not required.

### Research Design and Methods

This is the core of the proposal. Frame methods as an inferential design,
not a menu of techniques. Three moves dominate the strongest proposals:

**1. Specify the evidence.** What data will you generate? Interviews,
fieldnotes, documents, visual materials, surveys, digital traces? How many
of each, with whom, over what period? Wenner-Gren demands a detailed
description of the evidence that will be sought and a feasible plan for
gathering and analyzing it.

**2. Justify the site-method pairing.** Why does it make sense to address
these research questions through fieldwork in this specific place, with
these specific methods? Cambridge explicitly asks this question. The answer
should connect to the theoretical framework — not just "participant
observation is central to anthropology" but why this particular configuration
of methods generates the evidence needed to address these particular
questions.

**3. Show how analysis will proceed.** NSF requires a well-developed data
analysis plan (often about one page) explaining systematic analysis in
relation to specific questions or hypotheses. For qualitative projects,
specify: how coding categories will be generated (deductive from theory,
inductive from data, or hybrid); how triangulation will occur across data
forms; and what constitutes an analytic claim (pattern, mechanism, typology,
process model).

**Access and sampling.** Explicitly articulate the access pathway (how will
you gain entry?), sampling logic (how will you identify and recruit
participants?), and data-collection repertoire. Proposals that address
gatekeepers, rapport, and key informant location resolve a common feasibility
gap that reviewers notice.

**Stance-specific methods language.** Adjust the methods framing to match
the user's epistemic stance:
- Interpretivist: Foreground meaning-making, lived experience, emic
  categories, iterative interpretation.
- Critical: Foreground power relations, structural conditions, whose voices
  are amplified and whose are silenced.
- Phenomenological: Foreground embodied experience, sensory engagement,
  being-in-the-world.
- Decolonial/Indigenous: Foreground community authority, reciprocity,
  sovereignty over knowledge production.
- STS/infrastructure: Foreground material-semiotic assemblages, networks,
  nonhuman agencies.
- Applied/design: Foreground stakeholder engagement, intervention logic,
  outcomes measurement.
- Mixed-methods: Foreground complementarity, sequential or concurrent
  design, integration points.

(For the full list of 42 stances and their methods implications, see the
methods reference files in the academic-paper domain once available. Until
then, use the stance descriptions in DESIGN.md to calibrate language.)

### Contingency Planning (Plan B)

Wenner-Gren explicitly requires a Plan B methodology describing how research
questions will be addressed if travel or in-person fieldwork is not possible.
Even when not formally required, contingency planning signals sophistication.

Include: alternative sampling and data-collection pathways (remote
interviewing, archival pivots, digital ethnography, multi-sited
rebalancing), plus an explicit statement of what claims would no longer be
supportable under Plan B.

### Data Management

NSF requires a two-page data management and sharing plan. Even when not
funder-mandated, include a brief data management section covering: what data
will be produced, how it will be organized and stored, metadata standards,
confidentiality protections, and sharing plans.

Key tension to address: reconcile open-science norms (FAIR principles) with
community rights and ethical limits. Where research data implicate Indigenous
sovereignty, descendant communities, or culturally restricted knowledge, the
CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance should inform the plan.

Cambridge explicitly warns that cloud-based storage can move data across
borders even when the research does not — a data protection issue that must
be anticipated in the proposal.

### Ethics, Consent, and Access

Ethics should be a first-class section, not an afterthought. Wenner-Gren
devotes a distinct question to ethics and frames research ethics as extending
beyond anonymization and immediate risk, stressing obligations to
participants, descendant communities, and stakeholders.

Address:
- Consent modality (written, oral, ongoing/processual) and why it fits the
  research context
- Confidentiality and de-identification strategy
- Power dynamics between researcher and participants
- Community obligations and return-of-results plans
- Digital data protections (especially for cross-border data flows)
- How ethics will be revisited as the project evolves (processual ethics)

Calibrate to the user's risk posture parameter:
- Low-risk: Standard informed consent, de-identification, secure storage
- Vulnerable populations: Enhanced protections, community review, culturally
  appropriate consent processes
- High-surveillance contexts: Minimized digital footprint, encrypted
  communications, heightened attention to informant safety
- Politically sensitive: Additional protections for both participants and
  researcher; anticipate how findings could be misused

### Timeline and Feasibility

Include explicit pre-fieldwork workstreams: language training, institutional
affiliations, ethics/IRB clearance, pilot contacts, visa/permissions
processing. Do not start the clock at the first day "in the field."

Cambridge requires month-by-month timetables. Oxford expects a suitable
timetable demonstrating feasible completion in 3–4 years (full-time). Even
for US prospectuses without formal timeline requirements, a concrete timeline
signals preparedness.

A strong timeline typically includes:
- Pre-fieldwork preparation (3–12 months): language, methods training,
  ethics clearance, affiliations, pilot fieldwork
- Core fieldwork (9–18 months): participant observation, interviews, data
  collection
- Mid-field consolidation (1–3 months): preliminary analysis, backup data
  capture, reassessment
- Post-fieldwork analysis and writing (12–24 months): transcription, coding,
  thematic analysis, chapter drafting
- Revision and defense (3–6 months): committee review, revision, defense
  preparation

### Budget

Budgets are a design argument: they show that costs are necessary for the
evidence plan and signal preparedness. Cambridge requires clear tabular
budgets with itemized expenditure and month-by-month spending charts.

Funder rules differ materially:
- **NSF DDRIG:** Travel, data collection, modest equipment, participant
  incentives (with restrictions), local field assistance, travel-specific
  insurance, modest living expenses. Prohibits salary support and many
  transcription services.
- **Wenner-Gren:** Includes transcription costs, gifts for informants,
  specialized software. Does not fund pilot research or trips home for
  consultation.

Even if no funder is targeted yet, a credible budget demonstrates that the
researcher has thought through what the project actually requires.

### Bibliography

Use author-date citation format consistent with major anthropological
journals. Cite only sources actually engaged in the narrative — the
bibliography is not a reading list but a record of the intellectual
conversation the proposal participates in.

Wenner-Gren caps bibliographies at 10 pages. Be selective rather than
indiscriminate, but demonstrate range across theoretical, ethnographic, and
methodological literatures.

## Evaluation Criteria: What Reviewers Actually Judge

Five criteria appear repeatedly across programs and funders, even when
phrased differently:

1. **Problem significance.** Is this a real intellectual puzzle worth
   investigating?
2. **Contribution potential.** What will we know or understand differently as
   a result of this research?
3. **Feasibility.** Can this actually be done within the proposed timeframe
   and budget? Are the methods appropriate for the questions?
4. **Preparation.** Does the researcher demonstrate readiness (language,
   methods training, area knowledge, preliminary contacts)?
5. **Ethical rigor.** Has the researcher thought carefully about harm,
   consent, community obligations, and data protection?

NSF additionally evaluates "broader impacts" — how the research contributes
beyond the discipline (public engagement, training, policy relevance,
broadening participation). This must be labeled and substantively addressed.

Oxford's transfer criteria codify feasibility expectations: realistic, focused
aims; appropriate methodology; evidence of wide reading and critical analysis;
ethical compliance; and a feasible completion schedule.

Proposals must be understandable and persuasive beyond a narrow micro-field.
Reviewers may not be specialists in the applicant's exact subtopic.

## Common Failure Modes

Generate output that avoids these documented pitfalls:

| Failure mode | What goes wrong | How to prevent it |
|---|---|---|
| **Overbreadth** | Claims to answer many questions without convincing on any single one | Limit to 2–4 tightly articulated questions; demonstrate depth on each |
| **Mission mismatch** | Proposal oriented to applied policy or description without theory contribution | Connect every methods choice to a theoretical claim; show what conceptual work the evidence enables |
| **Ethics as afterthought** | Ethics section is perfunctory or boilerplate | Make ethics a workflow step throughout; address consent modality, community obligations, data protection substantively |
| **Vague analysis plan** | "I will use thematic analysis" without specification | Name the coding approach, triangulation strategy, and what constitutes an analytic claim |
| **Methods as menu** | Lists techniques without inferential logic | Frame methods as a design that generates specific evidence to answer specific questions |
| **Generic literature review** | Lists areas of scholarship without showing engagement | Make the literature review an argument about where this project intervenes |
| **No contingency** | Assumes fieldwork will proceed exactly as planned | Include Plan B with alternative methods and explicit statement of claim limitations |
| **Answers already known** | Proposal telegraphs its conclusions | Frame genuinely open questions; show what you expect but acknowledge uncertainty |

---

## Output Formatting

### Headings

Use high-signal headings. NSF explicitly recommends labeling intellectual
merit and requires a labeled broader impacts section — reviewers are cued by
headings, not only prose. Even for committee prospectuses, clear section
headers help tired readers navigate a long document.

### Citations

Use author-date format: (Author Year: page). Consistent with AAA style.
SAA style for archaeology uses year citations following author names and
disallows "ibid." and "op. cit." If the user's subfield uses different
conventions, adapt accordingly.

### Tone

The proposal should sound like a prepared, confident researcher who has
thought carefully about what they're doing and why — not a student asking
permission. Use first person where appropriate. Avoid false modesty but also
avoid overclaiming. Epistemic humility about what the research will and will
not be able to show is a mark of sophistication, not weakness.

## Examples

**Example 1: US sociocultural prospectus (Berkeley-style, 8–10 pages)**

Input: "I'm writing my prospectus for my QE at Berkeley. My project is about
how Senegalese migrants in Paris use WhatsApp groups to maintain
translocal kinship networks. I work within an interpretivist framework
drawing on practice theory and digital anthropology."

Output approach:
- Set length target to 8–10 pages (tight, grant-narrative style)
- Set epistemic stance to interpretivist + practice theory
- Set field configuration to multi-sited (Paris + digital spaces + Senegal)
- Frame research questions around meaning-making in digital kinship practice
- Literature review engages migration studies, digital anthropology, and
  Senegalese diaspora ethnography
- Methods emphasize participant observation in WhatsApp groups, life history
  interviews, and multi-sited fieldwork logic
- Analysis plan specifies iterative coding of digital interactions and
  interview transcripts with attention to practice-theoretical categories
- Brief timeline and budget since this is committee-facing

**Example 2: UK fieldwork proposal (Cambridge-style, ≤7,000 words)**

Input: "I need to write my fieldwork proposal for Cambridge clearance. My
research examines how Indigenous water governance in Bolivia's Altiplano
challenges liberal environmental frameworks. I work within decolonial
and political ecology traditions."

Output approach:
- Set length target to ≤7,000 words continuous prose
- Set epistemic stance to decolonial + political ecology
- Set field configuration to single site with comparative archival dimension
- Set risk posture to politically sensitive + Indigenous communities
- Cambridge requires: literature review (theoretical + ethnographic +
  regional context), questions and contribution, methodological discussion
  translating theory into empirical questions, practical/political/ethical
  issues, timetable, detailed budget, bibliography, permissions/visas
- Methods foreground community authority, reciprocity, and Indigenous
  knowledge sovereignty; include CARE Principles alongside FAIR for data
  management
- Ethics section is substantial: processual consent, community research
  agreements, decolonial ethics beyond IRB compliance
- Separate risk assessment form will also be needed (flag this for user)
- Month-by-month timetable required
- Detailed tabular budget required

**Example 3: Dual-purpose prospectus + NSF DDRIG**

Input: "I'm writing my dissertation prospectus and I also want to adapt it
for my NSF DDRIG application. My project studies algorithmic hiring
systems in tech companies from an STS perspective."

Output approach:
- Generate the committee prospectus first, then flag NSF-specific
  adaptations needed
- Load the nsf-cultural-anthro.md reference file alongside this one
- NSF requires: labeled intellectual merit section, labeled broader impacts,
  empirically driven questions subject to falsification, explicit analysis
  plan (~1 page), data management and sharing plan (2 pages, separate)
- Frame STS questions with falsifiable stakes (e.g., "If algorithmic hiring
  systems redistribute gatekeeping authority from human managers to technical
  infrastructures, then we should observe specific changes in how hiring
  decisions are justified, contested, and experienced by candidates")
- Broader impacts: connect to public understanding of algorithmic systems,
  training of graduate student, potential policy relevance
- Flag that NSF prohibits salary support and restricts certain budget items
