# Consent Design Guide

A reference for designing informed consent processes in qualitative and
ethnographic research. Covers conceptual foundations, regulatory frameworks,
consent modes, cultural adaptation, and practical documentation strategies.

## Consent as Process, Not Document

Anthropological research treats consent as an ongoing, negotiated, and
relational practice rather than a single administrative event. The American
Anthropological Association (AAA) holds that "the quality of the consent, not
the format, is relevant," emphasizing substance over paperwork. The Association
of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth (ASA) reinforces this
view: consent is a process, not a one-off event, and should be subject to
periodic renegotiation throughout the research relationship.

This distinction matters in practice. The **consent process** refers to the
continuing dialogue between researcher and participant through which
understanding, trust, and agreement are built and maintained. The **consent
documentation** (the form, recording, or written record) is simply the
artifact that captures a moment within that process.

The U.S. Common Rule explicitly separates the consent process from its
documentation. A researcher may obtain a waiver of written documentation while
still being required to conduct a full informed consent process. This
regulatory structure acknowledges that the conversation matters more than the
signature.

Consent should be initiated during the research design phase, not introduced
as an afterthought when fieldwork begins. In iterative field settings, consent
cannot be taken as given on day one. Relationships shift, research questions
evolve, and new activities emerge. A participant who agreed to an interview may
not have anticipated being quoted in a publication, or having their photograph
included in a presentation. Researchers must build mechanisms for returning to
the consent conversation at meaningful intervals.

**Key principles:**

- Consent is initiated during design and maintained through ongoing dialogue.
- The form documents consent; it does not constitute consent.
- Iterative fieldwork demands iterative consent.
- Participants should always understand what they are agreeing to right now,
  not just what they agreed to at the start.

## Regulatory Foundations

### U.S. Common Rule (45 CFR 46)

The federal regulations governing human subjects research in the United States
are codified at 45 CFR 46, commonly known as the Common Rule.

**Required elements of informed consent (45 CFR 46.116):**

1. A statement that the study involves research, an explanation of its
   purposes, expected duration, description of procedures, and identification
   of any experimental procedures.
2. A description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts.
3. A description of any benefits to the participant or to others.
4. A disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment.
5. A description of the extent to which confidentiality will be maintained.
6. For more-than-minimal-risk research, an explanation of compensation and
   available medical treatments if injury occurs.
7. Contact information for questions about the research and participants' rights.
8. A statement that participation is voluntary, refusal involves no penalty,
   and the participant may withdraw at any time.

**Key information requirement (revised Common Rule):** The 2018 revisions
require that consent begin with a concise presentation of the key information
most likely to help a prospective participant understand the reasons why one
might or might not want to participate.

**Waiver of documentation:** An IRB may waive the requirement for a signed
consent form when the only record linking participant to research would be the
consent document and the principal risk is breach of confidentiality, or when
the research presents no more than minimal risk and involves no procedures for
which written consent is normally required outside the research context.

**Waiver of consent elements:** In limited circumstances, an IRB may approve a
consent procedure that omits or alters some required elements, provided the
research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver, involves no
more than minimal risk, and the waiver will not adversely affect participants'
rights and welfare.

**Exempt categories relevant to qualitative research:** Certain categories are
exempt from full IRB review, including research involving surveys, interviews,
or observation of public behavior, provided information cannot be linked to
participants or disclosure would not place them at risk.

### Canadian TCPS 2

The Tri-Council Policy Statement (TCPS 2) governs research ethics in Canada.

**Chapter 9: Research involving Indigenous Peoples.** TCPS 2 dedicates an
entire chapter to ethical conduct in research with First Nations, Inuit, and
Metis communities. Key principles include community engagement as integral to
the research process, respect for community customs and codes of research
practice, and recognition that communities may have their own review processes.

**Community engagement.** Researchers are expected to engage with communities
before, during, and after research. This may involve formal research
agreements, community review of findings, and shared governance over data.

**Balancing individual and collective interests.** TCPS 2 requires researchers
to balance respect for individual autonomy with recognition that research may
affect the community as a whole. Community consent does not replace individual
consent, but may be a prerequisite for it.

### European Frameworks

**EU/Horizon Europe ethics requirements.** EU-funded research must comply with
ethics review procedures that include informed consent as a core requirement.
Horizon Europe requires ethics self-assessments and, for sensitive research,
formal ethics review by independent committees.

**GDPR implications for consent in research.** The General Data Protection
Regulation imposes specific requirements on processing personal data. GDPR
consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. Researchers
must distinguish between consent to participate in research (ethics consent)
and consent to process personal data (GDPR consent), as these serve different
legal purposes.

**Witnessed consent when written consent is not feasible.** European frameworks
recognize that written consent may not always be feasible. Witnessed verbal
consent or other culturally appropriate mechanisms may be used, provided the
process is documented.

### Other Frameworks

- **UK ESRC Framework for Research Ethics:** Emphasizes proportionate review,
  researcher responsibility, and ongoing consent in longitudinal and
  ethnographic research.
- **Australian NHMRC National Statement:** Provides Australian guidance with
  specific attention to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities,
  vulnerable populations, and community-level engagement.
- **CIOMS International Ethical Guidelines:** Addresses international
  collaborative research with guidance on consent in low-resource settings,
  community engagement, and balancing universal principles with local norms.

## Consent Modes

| Mode | When to Use | Documentation | Advantages | Limitations |
|------|-------------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Written (signed form) | Standard IRB expectation; literate population; non-sensitive topics | Signed consent form | Clear documentation trail; familiar to IRBs | Can feel bureaucratic; may increase risk if signature creates a traceable record |
| Verbal with information sheet | Low-literacy settings; signatures increase risk; minimal-risk research | Witness note + information sheet participant keeps | Culturally flexible; reduces documentation risk | Harder to prove to IRBs; requires witness protocol |
| Recorded oral consent | Moderate risk; need documentation but not signatures | Audio recording of consent conversation | Documented without signature; flexible across literacy levels | Requires separate consent to record the consent conversation |
| Layered/tiered consent | Multiple components (interview + recording + photos) | Separate consent for each tier | Participants choose level of involvement | More complex; multiple documents |
| Community consent + individual | Indigenous communities; collective governance | Community agreement + individual forms | Respects collective rights; culturally appropriate | Two-layer process; may be slow |
| Ongoing/process consent | Participant observation; longitudinal; evolving designs | Field diary notes; periodic check-ins | Matches ethnographic reality | Less documentable; relies on researcher integrity |

**Choosing a mode:** Selection should be guided by context, population, risk
level, and regulatory requirements. Many studies combine modes, for example
community consent followed by individual written consent with process consent
maintained throughout fieldwork.

## Essential Elements of Consent

### 1. Study Purpose and Procedures
Explain the research in plain language. Describe what participation actually
involves: what the participant will do, how long it will take, where
interactions will occur, and what topics will be discussed. If the design is
emergent, say so and explain how the participant will be informed as activities
evolve.

### 2. Voluntariness and Withdrawal
State clearly that participation is voluntary. The participant may decline any
question, stop an interview, or withdraw entirely without penalty. Describe
what happens to their data if they withdraw and set a clear deadline after
which withdrawal of data may not be possible.

### 3. Risks and Benefits
Provide an honest assessment. Name possibilities for discomfort, emotional
distress, or social risk if confidentiality is breached. If there is no direct
benefit to the participant, say so plainly. Do not inflate potential benefits.

### 4. Confidentiality and Data Use
Describe specific measures: pseudonyms, removal of identifying details,
encrypted storage, restricted access. Be honest about limits. Small
communities or distinctive roles may make full anonymity difficult. Disclose
legal limits to confidentiality such as mandatory reporting requirements.

### 5. Recordings and Images
Obtain separate, tiered consent for each media type. A participant may agree
to an interview but not to recording, to audio but not video, to being
photographed but not to publication of photographs. Explain storage, access,
and whether recordings will be destroyed after transcription.

### 6. Data Sharing and Future Use
Consent language must match actual data management plans. If data may be used
in future studies, shared with collaborators, or deposited in a repository,
the consent must say so explicitly.

### 7. Special Populations
For minors, obtain both guardian/parental consent and the child's assent using
age-appropriate language. For other populations requiring additional
protections, see the dedicated section below.

### 8. Contacts
Provide contact information for the principal investigator, the IRB or
research ethics committee, and any local contacts. Participants should know
whom to reach with questions, concerns, or complaints.

## Cultural Adaptation and Power Dynamics

Consent is not culturally neutral. Processes designed in institutional settings
may not translate directly to the communities where research takes place.

**Consulting community leaders and elders.** Where culturally expected, seek
community-level permission or endorsement before individual recruitment. This
does not replace individual consent but may be a prerequisite for it.

**Group consent versus individual consent.** Group consent may be appropriate
when research affects the community as a whole, when cultural norms require
collective decision-making, or when the research involves shared cultural
knowledge. Individual consent remains necessary for personal participation.

**Adapting format.** Use oral explanations when written forms are not
practical. Employ visual aids, diagrams, or illustrations. Translate materials
into local languages. Use interpreters and ensure they understand the consent
process and the importance of accurate, unembellished translation.

**Power imbalances.** Researchers hold power relative to participants by
virtue of institutional affiliation, education, and control over the research
process. Additional imbalances arise when participants are employees, students,
patients, or members of marginalized groups. Avoid recruiting through authority
figures who could create implicit pressure to participate.

**Genuine agency to refuse.** Consent is only meaningful if refusal is a real
option. Assess whether participants can genuinely say no without social,
economic, or relational consequences. If not, redesign the consent process.

**Low-literacy settings.** Use large fonts, simple layouts, and visual
elements. Read consent information aloud. Allow time for questions. Do not
assume that signing a form indicates understanding.

**Translation and back-translation.** Use professional translators familiar
with research terminology and local dialects. Back-translate consent materials
to verify accuracy. Have community members review for clarity and cultural
appropriateness.

**Cultural norms around agreements.** Some cultures expect group permission
before an individual can consent. Others may view signing a document as
implying distrust. Adapt the format and sequence to align with local
expectations while meeting ethical and regulatory requirements.

**When written forms are inappropriate or dangerous.** In contexts involving
political repression, illegal activities, or severe stigma, a signed form can
be a liability. Seek an IRB waiver of documentation and use verbal consent.

## Readability and Plain Language

- **Target reading level:** 6th to 8th grade for general populations.
- **Sentence length:** Average 15 to 20 words. Break complex ideas into
  multiple shorter sentences.
- **Structure:** Use bullet points, numbered lists, and clear headings.
- **Define terms:** Explain technical or research-specific terms at first use.
- **Avoid legal language:** "Hereby," "notwithstanding," "aforementioned," and
  "indemnify" have no place in qualitative consent forms.
- **Test readability:** Use Flesch-Kincaid, Gunning Fog, or similar measures.
- **Information hierarchy:** Present the most important information first.
- **Reasonable length:** Cover essentials without overwhelming. Consider a
  brief consent form paired with a detailed information sheet.

---

## Documentation and Recordkeeping

Consent records require careful handling because they link participants to
their involvement in research, creating a confidentiality risk in themselves.

**Separate storage.** Store consent forms separately from research data. Use
coded identifiers to connect consent records to data when necessary.

**Retention requirements.** Institutional and regulatory requirements typically
mandate retaining consent records for three to seven years after study
completion. Confirm requirements with your IRB before establishing a schedule.

**Documenting oral consent.** When written consent is waived, document through
field diary entries (noting date, time, location, topics covered, and
agreement), witness signatures on a separate log, or audio recording.

**Archiving materials.** Retain copies of all materials provided to
participants, including information sheets, FAQs, and translated versions.

**Recording method of consent.** Maintain a log noting the method used
(written, verbal, recorded), the date, and any witness. Store securely with
other consent records.

**Re-consent and withdrawal.** When consent is revisited or a participant
withdraws, record the date, circumstances, changes to involvement, and
actions taken regarding their data.

**Audit trail.** Maintain records sufficient for ethics monitoring and audit.
Clear, organized documentation protects both participants and researchers.

---

## Consent for Special Populations

**Minors.** Requires both parental/guardian consent and the minor's assent.
Use age-appropriate language. For young children, simple verbal explanations
and the opportunity to say no. For adolescents, a more detailed assent form.
In some jurisdictions, mature minors may consent independently.

**Prisoners and detained persons.** Inherent coercion requires additional
safeguards to ensure participation is not perceived as linked to privileges,
parole, or conditions of confinement. IRBs typically require specific
justification and may impose additional review.

**Patients in clinical settings.** Participants may conflate research with
treatment. Clearly distinguish between clinical care and research. State that
declining participation will not affect care.

**Employees and students.** Address potential for perceived coercion. Use
third-party recruiters, ensure supervisors do not know who participates, and
state that participation has no bearing on employment or academic standing.

**Trauma-affected populations.** Include information about potential distress,
the right to pause or stop, and available support resources. Have a distress
protocol in place before beginning data collection.

**Cognitively impaired individuals.** Assess capacity case by case. Obtain
consent from a legally authorized representative when necessary while seeking
the participant's assent. Reassess capacity periodically if it may fluctuate.

**Participants in illegal activities.** Heightened confidentiality concerns.
Address legal risks honestly. Consider a Certificate of Confidentiality (U.S.)
or equivalent protections. Participants should understand both the protections
in place and their limits.

## Common IRB/REC Pitfalls

Qualitative researchers frequently encounter friction with IRBs or RECs whose
procedures are calibrated for clinical trials and experimental designs.

| Pitfall | Why It Happens | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Static consent template without explaining iterative fieldwork | IRB forms assume a fixed protocol | Include a process consent narrative describing how consent will be revisited; provide re-consent examples |
| Overemphasis on signed forms when oral consent is more appropriate | Default procedures assume written documentation | Request waiver under 45 CFR 46.117(c); justify why oral consent better protects participants |
| Neglecting community or group consent | IRB frameworks center on individual autonomy | Describe community engagement plans; reference TCPS 2 Chapter 9 and NHMRC guidelines; include community agreements |
| Underestimating confidentiality issues with recordings | Reviewers may not anticipate identifiability risks in small communities | Address recording risks explicitly; describe storage, access controls, and destruction timelines |
| Failing to justify deviations from standard consent format | Reviewers expect standard forms | Provide clear rationale citing literature, regulatory provisions, and precedent |
| Not explaining ethnographic methods to unfamiliar reviewers | Many IRB members come from biomedical backgrounds | Include a methodological summary; define unfamiliar terms; reference disciplinary ethics codes |
| Overpromising protections | Desire to reassure the IRB exceeds actual capacity | Be honest about limits; use "I will take steps to protect" rather than absolute guarantees |
| Consent language mismatched with data management plans | Forms drafted before plans are finalized | Draft consent and data management plans together; submit amendments if plans change |

**General strategies for working with IRBs:**

- Include a methods summary and relevant literature in the submission.
- Reference professional ethics codes (AAA, ASA, ESRC) to demonstrate
  disciplinary standards.
- Offer to meet with the board to discuss unfamiliar methods.
- Frame non-standard approaches as participant-protective, not as shortcuts.
- Submit detailed protocols that anticipate reviewer questions.

## Summary

Effective consent in qualitative research is grounded in respect for
participants, responsiveness to context, and honesty about what the research
involves. The form is a tool; the relationship is the foundation. Design
consent processes that are as thoughtful and adaptive as the research itself.
