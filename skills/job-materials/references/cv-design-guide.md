# Academic CV Design Guide for Anthropologists

## Purpose

The academic CV is the foundational document of any application package. It is a comprehensive record of your scholarly life -- every publication, presentation, grant, course, and professional activity. Unlike a resume, it grows over a career. Unlike a cover letter, it does not argue; it demonstrates. The CV's job is to make your qualifications visible, organized, and easy to evaluate.

Search committees spend 2-5 minutes on an initial CV review. If the structure is non-standard or the formatting inconsistent, the committee struggles to find what it needs and moves on. Following conventions is not optional -- it is how you communicate competence in the profession.

## Standard Section Ordering

The order below is standard for anthropology. Some variation is acceptable, but the top sections should always appear first. Sections with no content should be omitted entirely, not included with "N/A."

### Required Sections (in order)

1. **Contact Information**
2. **Education**
3. **Academic Positions** (or Employment)
4. **Publications**
5. **Grants and Fellowships**
6. **Invited Talks**
7. **Conference Presentations**
8. **Teaching Experience**
9. **Service**
10. **Languages**
11. **References**

### Optional Sections (placed according to relevance)

- Fieldwork Experience
- Advising and Mentoring
- Professional Memberships
- Media Coverage or Public Scholarship
- Digital Projects or Public Humanities
- Methods Training or Certifications
- Honors and Awards (if not combined with Grants)
- Professional Development

### Section Ordering by Career Stage

**ABD candidates**: Education goes first (it is your primary credential). Follow with Publications (even if the section is short), then Grants, then Teaching. Move Fieldwork higher if it is extensive and relevant.

**Recent PhD (0-3 years)**: Education first, then Academic Positions (including postdoc), then Publications, then Grants. Teaching follows unless applying to a teaching-focused position, in which case it moves up.

**Early to mid-career (3-15 years)**: Academic Positions first (your current role is now your primary credential), then Publications, then Grants. Education moves lower. Teaching and Service fill out the document.

**Senior scholars (15+ years)**: Academic Positions first, then Publications (which may be extensive). Consider subcategorizing Publications (Books, Edited Volumes, Journal Articles, Book Chapters, Book Reviews). Grants and Service may be substantial sections.

## Length Norms by Career Stage

| Career Stage | Expected Length | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ABD | 2-4 pages | Short is fine. Do not pad. |
| Recent PhD (0-3 years) | 3-6 pages | Growing but still concise. |
| Early career (3-7 years) | 5-10 pages | Publications and grants filling in. |
| Mid-career (7-15 years) | 8-15 pages | Substantial record. Subcategorize as needed. |
| Senior (15+ years) | 15-30+ pages | Comprehensive. May need selective presentation for some purposes. |

A short CV at the ABD stage is not a weakness. A padded CV at any stage is a weakness. Include only items that genuinely represent your scholarly work and professional contributions.

## Contact Information

Place at the top of the first page. Include:

- Full name (as it appears on publications)
- Institutional affiliation and department
- Institutional address
- Email (institutional preferred)
- Phone (optional)
- Personal academic website (if maintained and professional)
- ORCID (increasingly expected)

Do not include: date of birth, marital status, photograph, nationality, social media handles (unless directly relevant to your scholarly work), or personal address.

## Education Section

List degrees in reverse chronological order. Include:

- Degree type (PhD, MA, BA)
- Institution
- Year conferred (or "Expected [Year]" for in-progress)
- Dissertation or thesis title (for graduate degrees)
- Committee chair or advisor name
- Fields or concentrations

```
PhD, Anthropology, University of Michigan, 2023
  Dissertation: "Water, Power, Infrastructure: Everyday Politics of
  Development in Rural Tamil Nadu"
  Committee: [Chair Name] (chair), [Member], [Member], [Member]

MA, Anthropology, University of Chicago, 2018

BA, Anthropology and Environmental Studies, Oberlin College, 2015
  Magna cum laude
```

Do not list coursework, GPA (unless applying for positions that request it), or high school education.

## Academic Positions

List in reverse chronological order. Include title, department, institution, and dates. For current positions, use "present" as the end date.

```
Assistant Professor, Department of Anthropology, University of Oregon, 2024-present
Postdoctoral Fellow, School for Advanced Research, 2022-2024
```

For ABD candidates with no academic positions, this section may be omitted or replaced with "Research and Teaching Experience" that combines RA/TA roles.

## Publications

This is the most scrutinized section for research positions. Organize into subsections as your record grows.

### Subsection Order

1. **Books** (authored monographs)
2. **Edited Volumes**
3. **Peer-Reviewed Journal Articles**
4. **Book Chapters** (in edited volumes)
5. **Book Reviews**
6. **Other Publications** (encyclopedia entries, reports, op-eds, public scholarship)

### Citation Format

Use a consistent citation style throughout. The American Anthropologist style (AAA) is standard for the discipline but not strictly required. Whatever style you choose, apply it uniformly.

```
Peer-Reviewed Journal Articles

Martinez, Elena. 2024. "Infrastructure as Intimacy: Water Politics and
  Domestic Life in Rural Tamil Nadu." American Ethnologist 51(2): 234-251.

Martinez, Elena, and Priya Sharma. 2023. "Pipe Dreams: Materiality and
  Promise in South Asian Water Systems." Journal of the Royal Anthropological
  Institute 29(1): 112-130.
```

### Author Order Conventions

- List yourself in the author position as it appears on the publication. Do not rearrange to put yourself first.
- For co-authored work, anthropology generally uses alphabetical ordering or ordering based on contribution. If your field or collaborators use a different convention, follow it.
- You may bold or underline your name to make it easy to find in multi-author citations.

### Status Designations

- **Published**: Full citation with year, volume, pages
- **Forthcoming**: Accepted and in press. Include journal name. Do not include speculative publication dates.
- **Under review**: Use sparingly. Only list if the manuscript is genuinely submitted and under review at a specific journal. Do not name the journal.
- **In preparation**: Use very sparingly, if at all. Only for manuscripts that substantially exist. Many search committees discount "in preparation" items entirely. If you have more than 2-3 items in preparation, it looks like padding.

```
Forthcoming. "Title." Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology.

Under review. "Title."

In preparation. "Title." (use only if manuscript substantially exists)
```

### What Counts as a Publication

- Peer-reviewed journal articles: highest value for research positions
- Books (monographs): the gold standard in cultural anthropology; important but weighted differently in biological and archaeological anthropology
- Edited volumes: demonstrate intellectual leadership but weigh less than authored books
- Book chapters: solid contributions but weigh less than journal articles for hiring
- Book reviews: show engagement with the field but are minor items
- Reports, white papers, policy briefs: valuable for applied positions; include in a separate subsection
- Blog posts, op-eds, public writing: include in "Public Scholarship" or "Other Publications" if substantial

## Grants and Fellowships

List in reverse chronological order. Include:

- Grant or fellowship name
- Funding agency
- Amount (in USD or relevant currency)
- Dates
- Your role (PI, co-PI, senior personnel, consultant)
- Brief title or description (one line)

```
Grants and Fellowships

National Science Foundation, Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement
  Grant (BCS-2012345), $18,750, 2021-2023, PI.
  "Water Infrastructure and Political Subjectivity in Rural Tamil Nadu"

Wenner-Gren Foundation, Dissertation Fieldwork Grant, $20,000, 2020-2021, PI.

Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship (Tamil), U.S. Department of
  Education, $15,000, 2019-2020.
```

Include both external (federal, foundation) and internal (university) grants. External grants carry more weight but internal grants show initiative. Separate funded grants from awards/honors if you have enough of each to warrant separate sections.

For unfunded grant applications, do not list them. Unlike publications, there is no "under review" convention for grants on a CV.

## Invited Talks

Distinct from conference presentations. Invited talks are those where a department, center, or organization specifically asked you to present. List in reverse chronological order with title, venue, and date.

```
Invited Talks

"Water Politics Beyond the Pipe: Infrastructure and Everyday Life."
  Department of Anthropology, Stanford University, March 2024.

"Ethnography of Infrastructure." Water Futures Initiative, MIT, October 2023.
```

## Conference Presentations

List in reverse chronological order. Include paper title, session or panel title (optional), conference name, location, and date.

```
Conference Presentations

"Leaking States: Infrastructure Failure as Political Critique." Annual
  Meeting of the American Anthropological Association, Toronto, November 2023.

"Pipe Dreams and Broken Promises." Annual Conference on South Asia,
  Madison, WI, October 2023.
```

### What to Include

- National and international conferences (AAA, SfAA, AAPA, SAA, and subfield conferences)
- Significant regional conferences
- Invited panels and organized sessions (note if you organized the session)

### What to Exclude

- Departmental brown bags and colloquia (unless your CV is very short)
- Undergraduate conferences (unless you were an invited speaker)
- Poster sessions can be included but distinguished from paper presentations

## Teaching Experience

Organize by role and responsibility level.

### Subsection Options

- **Courses Designed and Taught** (full responsibility, your course)
- **Courses Taught** (existing course, full responsibility)
- **Teaching Assistant** (supporting role)
- **Guest Lectures**
- **Workshops and Short Courses**

```
Teaching Experience

Courses Designed and Taught
  ANTH 380: Water, Power, and Environment. University of Oregon, Spring 2025.
  ANTH 101: Introduction to Cultural Anthropology. University of Michigan,
    Fall 2021.

Teaching Assistant
  ANTH 101: Introduction to Cultural Anthropology. University of Michigan,
    Fall 2019, Winter 2020.
  ANTH 325: Ethnographic Methods. University of Michigan, Fall 2020.
```

For each course, include the course number, title, institution, and term. You may add enrollment numbers if they are impressive. Do not include syllabi on the CV itself -- those belong in a teaching portfolio.

### Teaching-Focused Positions

If applying to a SLAC or teaching-focused position, move Teaching higher in the CV (after Publications or even after Education for ABD candidates with strong teaching records). Add more detail: pedagogical approach, assessment innovations, student outcomes.

## Advising and Mentoring

Include if you have formal advising roles:

- Dissertation committee memberships
- MA thesis advising
- Undergraduate honors thesis advising
- Mentoring programs (formal roles)

```
Advising and Mentoring

Dissertation Committee Member
  [Student Name], Department of Anthropology, University of Oregon,
    2024-present.

Undergraduate Honors Thesis Advisor
  [Student Name], "Thesis Title," University of Oregon, 2024-2025.
```

## Service

Organize by level: departmental, university, professional, community.

```
Service

Departmental
  Graduate Admissions Committee, Department of Anthropology, University of
    Oregon, 2024-2025.
  Colloquium Organizer, Department of Anthropology, University of Oregon,
    2024-present.

Professional
  Manuscript Reviewer: American Ethnologist, Cultural Anthropology, Journal
    of the Royal Anthropological Institute.
  Session Organizer, Annual Meeting of the American Anthropological
    Association, 2023.

Community
  Board Member, [Local Organization], 2024-present.
```

## Languages

List languages with proficiency levels. Be honest -- search committees in area studies may test your claims informally during campus visits.

```
Languages

Tamil: advanced speaking, reading, writing (24 months fieldwork)
Hindi: intermediate speaking, basic reading
French: reading proficiency
```

Use a consistent proficiency framework. Terms like "native," "fluent," "advanced," "intermediate," "basic/reading" are standard. You may also note the context of acquisition (fieldwork, study abroad, heritage language).

## Fieldwork Experience

Especially important for cultural, archaeological, and linguistic anthropologists. List field sites, dates, and brief descriptions of the project.

```
Fieldwork Experience

Rural Tamil Nadu, India, 18 months (2020-2022). Doctoral dissertation
  fieldwork on water infrastructure and political subjectivity.
Chennai, India, 3 months (2019). Preliminary dissertation research and
  language study.
Oaxaca, Mexico, 2 months (2017). MA thesis fieldwork on artisan markets
  and tourism.
```

For archaeologists, include site names, your role (PI, field director, crew), and the nature of the project (excavation, survey, lab analysis).

## References

List 3-5 references with full contact information: name, title, institution, email, phone. Your dissertation advisor should typically be first.

Confirm with your references before listing them. Alert them when you submit applications so they can prepare letters.

## Formatting Conventions

### General Rules

- Use a clean, readable font: Times New Roman, Garamond, Calibri, or similar. 11-12 point for body text.
- Margins: 1 inch on all sides.
- Consistent formatting throughout. If you bold journal names, bold all journal names. If you italicize book titles, italicize all book titles.
- Reverse chronological order within every section.
- No color, no graphics, no decorative elements. Academic CVs are austere documents.
- Page numbers on every page after the first.
- Your name and "Curriculum Vitae" (or just your name) as a header on the first page.
- Date the CV: include "Updated [Month Year]" at the top or bottom.

### Common Formatting Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Inconsistent date formats | Signals carelessness. Pick one format and use it everywhere. |
| Missing page numbers | Committee members print CVs. Unnumbered pages get lost. |
| Mixing citation styles | Undermines credibility. Use one style consistently. |
| Including a photo | Not standard in US academic CVs. May trigger bias. |
| Personal information (age, marital status) | Not appropriate for US academic CVs. May trigger bias. |
| Decorative formatting (colors, borders, icons) | Reads as unprofessional in academic contexts. |
| Unexplained gaps | Better to note a leave or career break briefly than to leave an unexplained gap. |
| Listing every workshop or webinar attended | Padding. Include only significant professional development. |

## Subfield-Specific Variations

### Archaeology

- Fieldwork experience is a major section. List excavations, surveys, and lab work prominently.
- Technical skills matter: GIS, remote sensing, statistical software, dating methods. Include a "Technical Skills" or "Methods" section.
- CRM (cultural resource management) experience is relevant for many positions. List separately from academic fieldwork if needed.
- Publications may include technical reports and site reports in addition to peer-reviewed articles.

### Biological/Physical Anthropology

- Lab skills and technical methods are important. Include a "Technical Skills" or "Laboratory Methods" section.
- Grant funding may come from NIH, NSF BCS, or other biomedical sources. Note the funding mechanism.
- Publications may follow a different author-order convention (contribution-based rather than alphabetical). Follow the norm for your specific area.
- Datasets and code repositories may be listed in a "Data and Code" section.

### Linguistic Anthropology

- Language proficiency is a major qualification. Expand the Languages section with detail about documentary or analytical work.
- Technical skills in transcription, corpus analysis, or acoustic analysis may warrant a separate section.
- Fieldwork may include language documentation projects with specific communities.

### Applied Anthropology

- Community partnerships and collaborative projects deserve their own section or prominent placement.
- Reports, policy briefs, and white papers are significant publications. Do not bury them.
- Professional experience outside academia (NGO work, consulting, government) belongs in a prominent position, not hidden under "Other Experience."
- Skills like program evaluation, UX research, or policy analysis may be listed.

## Digital and Web Presence

Consider including:

- **Personal academic website**: A professional website with your CV, publications, research description, and contact information. Keep it updated or do not have one.
- **ORCID**: Increasingly expected. Provides a persistent digital identifier for your scholarly work.
- **Google Scholar profile**: Makes your citation metrics visible. Useful if your metrics are strong.

Do not include social media handles unless your social media presence is directly relevant to your scholarly work (e.g., you maintain a professional blog or podcast on your research area).

## Converting Academic CV to Non-Academic Resume

If pursuing alt-ac or industry positions, the CV must be transformed, not merely trimmed.

### Key Differences

| Academic CV | Non-Academic Resume |
|---|---|
| Comprehensive record | Targeted to specific position |
| No length limit | 1-2 pages maximum |
| Education first (early career) | Experience first |
| Publications prominent | Skills and accomplishments prominent |
| Jargon acceptable | Plain language required |
| Describes what you did | Describes impact and results |

### Conversion Steps

1. Start fresh. Do not edit the CV into a resume; build the resume from scratch.
2. Lead with a professional summary (2-3 sentences) that translates your expertise into the language of the target sector.
3. Reorganize experience around skills and accomplishments, not academic categories.
4. Translate academic activities into transferable terms: "project management" not "dissertation research," "stakeholder engagement" not "ethnographic fieldwork," "qualitative data analysis" not "participant observation."
5. Quantify where possible: number of students taught, grant dollars managed, publications produced.
6. Remove or minimize: dissertation title, conference presentations, academic service, course listings. Include only if directly relevant to the target position.
7. Add skills section: software proficiency, languages, methods, certifications.
