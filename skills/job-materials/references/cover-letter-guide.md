# Cover Letter Guide for Academic Anthropology Positions

## Purpose

The cover letter is your argument for fit. While the CV shows what you have done, the cover letter explains why it matters and why it matters to this department at this institution for this position. A strong cover letter does three things: it demonstrates that you understand what the position requires, it shows that your qualifications meet those requirements, and it gives the committee a sense of who you would be as a colleague.

Search committees read dozens to hundreds of cover letters per search. Generic letters are immediately obvious and signal that the candidate either does not care about the specific position or does not understand how academic hiring works. Every letter must be tailored.

The cover letter is also the only document in your application package where you can make an explicit argument. The CV demonstrates; the writing sample shows; but the cover letter argues. It argues that your specific combination of research, teaching, and service makes you the right person for this position at this institution at this time. That argument must be specific, evidenced, and tailored.

## Cover Letter Architecture

The standard academic cover letter follows a five-part structure. This architecture is conventional and expected. Innovation happens within each section, not by rearranging them.

### Part 1: Opening Paragraph

**Purpose**: Identify yourself, name the position, and establish fit.

**Content**:
- Your name and current position (or "I am a doctoral candidate in...")
- The specific position you are applying for (title, department, institution)
- One or two sentences that preview your fit -- what makes you right for this particular job
- Optionally, a brief note about how you learned of the position or a connection to the department

**Length**: 3-5 sentences

**Common mistakes**:
- Opening with "I am writing to apply for..." without any indication of fit. This is technically correct but wastes the most valuable real estate in the letter.
- Being so vague that the opening could apply to any position. Name the institution, reference something specific.
- Overselling: "I am the ideal candidate" reads as presumptuous. Let your qualifications speak.

**Stronger opening**: "As a sociocultural anthropologist specializing in water politics and infrastructure in South Asia, I am writing to apply for the Assistant Professor position in the Department of Anthropology at [University]. My research on the everyday political dimensions of development projects, combined with my experience teaching environmental anthropology and ethnographic methods, aligns closely with the department's strengths in political ecology and environmental justice."

### Part 2: Research Paragraph(s)

**Purpose**: Describe your research program -- past, present, and future.

**Content**:
- Your central research questions and why they matter
- Key findings or arguments from your completed work (dissertation, publications)
- Current projects and their trajectory
- Future research directions
- How your research connects to or complements work in the department

**Length**: 1-2 paragraphs (approximately 1/3 of the letter for research positions)

**Critical distinction**: This is not a dissertation abstract. Do not summarize your dissertation chapter by chapter. Instead, articulate a research program. What are the big questions you pursue? What methods do you use? What have you found so far? Where are you going next? How does this contribute to the discipline?

**For R1 positions**: This section is the heart of the letter. Spend more space here. Mention publications and grants specifically. Describe the book manuscript if you have one. Outline the next major project.

**For SLAC positions**: Keep this section concise but substantive. Emphasize how your research involves undergraduates, connects to broad intellectual questions, and integrates with your teaching.

**For postdocs**: Focus on what you will accomplish during the postdoc period. Show fit with the host lab, project, or center.

### Part 3: Teaching Paragraph(s)

**Purpose**: Describe your teaching experience, philosophy, and what you can offer.

**Content**:
- Courses you have taught and designed
- Your pedagogical approach with specific examples (not abstract statements)
- Courses you can teach from the job ad
- New courses you would develop
- Evidence of teaching effectiveness (awards, evaluations, innovations)
- Advising and mentoring experience

**Length**: 1-2 paragraphs

**For R1 positions**: One solid paragraph. Name courses you can teach (especially from the ad). Mention graduate mentoring if applicable. Keep it substantive but proportionate -- research is the primary evaluation criterion.

**For SLAC positions**: This is the heart of the letter. Spend more space here. Describe specific pedagogical strategies. Name the courses from the ad and explain your approach to teaching them. Describe courses you would design that complement the existing curriculum. Discuss advising, mentoring, and involving students in research.

**For balanced institutions**: Give research and teaching roughly equal space.

**Common mistakes**:
- Abstract statements without evidence: "I am passionate about teaching" or "I believe in student-centered pedagogy" without any specific examples.
- Listing courses without describing your approach.
- Ignoring the courses specifically named in the job ad.

### Part 4: Service and Collegiality Paragraph

**Purpose**: Show that you would be a good departmental citizen and institutional contributor.

**Content**:
- Departmental service experience (committees, event organizing, mentoring programs)
- Professional service (journal reviewing, conference organizing, association work)
- Interdisciplinary interests and collaborations
- Community engagement (if relevant to the position or institution)
- How you would contribute to the department's intellectual life beyond your own courses

**Length**: 1 short paragraph (3-5 sentences)

This section is often underestimated. In small departments especially, collegiality and service capacity matter enormously. A brilliant researcher who will not attend department meetings or advise students is a liability.

**For SLACs and small departments**: Give this more attention. These departments need people who will serve on committees, advise students outside the classroom, and contribute to the broader intellectual community.

### Part 5: Closing Paragraph

**Purpose**: Express enthusiasm, note logistics, and close professionally.

**Content**:
- Brief restatement of your enthusiasm for the position and fit with the department
- Note that your application materials (CV, statements, writing sample, letters) are enclosed or submitted through the system
- Availability for further conversation
- Professional sign-off

**Length**: 2-4 sentences

**Do not**: Repeat your entire argument. The closing should be brief and forward-looking.

**Sample closing**: "I am enthusiastic about the possibility of joining the Department of Anthropology at [University] and contributing to its strengths in environmental anthropology and undergraduate research mentoring. My application materials, including my CV, research statement, teaching statement, and writing sample, are enclosed. I welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further and can be reached at [email] or [phone]. Thank you for your consideration."

## How to Read a Job Ad

The job ad is the single most important document for writing your cover letter. It tells you what the department wants, what they value, and what your letter must address.

### Required vs. Preferred Qualifications

- **Required qualifications**: You must meet these or explain convincingly why your alternative experience is equivalent. If the ad requires a PhD and you are ABD, note your expected completion date.
- **Preferred qualifications**: Address these if you can. Each preferred qualification you meet strengthens your application.

### Decoding Common Ad Language

| Ad Language | What It Signals |
|---|---|
| "Research university" or "active research program expected" | R1 priorities. Lead with research. Publications and grants matter most. |
| "Teaching excellence" or "commitment to undergraduate education" | Teaching-focused institution. Lead with teaching. Show pedagogical depth. |
| "Ability to teach [specific courses]" | You must address these courses specifically in your letter. |
| "Broadly trained" or "generalist" | They want someone who can teach across the subfield, not just their specialization. |
| "Collaborative" or "interdisciplinary" | They value working across boundaries. Name specific collaborations and connections. |
| "Contribute to department's commitment to diversity" | Address your experience with inclusive pedagogy, diverse student populations, or research on equity. |
| "Area specialization open" | The subfield matters more than the region. Frame your work theoretically. |
| "Joint appointment with [other department]" | You must demonstrate competence in both fields. Address both departments in your letter. |
| "Community engagement" or "public scholarship" | Applied and publicly engaged work is valued. Mention relevant experience. |
| "Complement existing faculty strengths" | Research the faculty. Position yourself to fill a gap, not duplicate existing expertise. |

### What the Ad Does Not Say

Read the department website alongside the ad. Look at:

- **Current faculty**: Who is there? What do they work on? Where are the gaps? Who might be retiring?
- **Recent hires**: What areas has the department been investing in? This signals institutional direction.
- **Curriculum**: What courses exist? What is missing? Where could you contribute?
- **Strategic plans or mission statements**: What does the institution value?
- **Student demographics**: What population will you teach? How does this shape pedagogy?

## Department Research Before Writing

Before writing a single sentence of your cover letter, spend 1-2 hours researching the department and institution.

### What to Research

1. **Faculty profiles**: Read brief descriptions of each faculty member's research. Identify potential intellectual connections to your work. You do not need to name every connection in the letter, but knowing the landscape shapes how you frame your fit.

2. **Recent hires**: The last 3-5 hires tell you what direction the department is moving. If they recently hired an environmental anthropologist and are now hiring a medical anthropologist, do not pitch yourself primarily as an environmental anthropologist.

3. **Curriculum**: Look at the course catalog. What courses exist? What levels (intro, methods, seminars)? Where are the gaps? Propose courses that fill gaps rather than duplicate offerings.

4. **Centers, institutes, and programs**: Many faculty have affiliations with interdisciplinary centers. If you could contribute to a relevant center, mention it.

5. **Institutional mission**: Is this a land-grant university? A Jesuit college? A historically Black college or university? An institution with a strong environmental focus? Institutional mission shapes what is valued.

6. **Graduate or undergraduate focus**: Does the department have a graduate program? If so, mentioning graduate mentoring is important. If it is undergraduate-only, focus on undergraduate research and advising.

### How to Reference Your Research Without Name-Dropping

When connecting your work to the department, reference intellectual areas rather than individual faculty names unless the connection is genuinely substantive. Saying "I look forward to collaborating with Professor X" when you have no real knowledge of their work reads as superficial. Instead: "My work on water infrastructure connects to the department's broader strengths in environmental anthropology and political ecology." If you have a genuine intellectual connection to a specific faculty member's work, name it with specificity: "My analysis of state infrastructure projects builds on the theoretical framework of everyday governance that Professor X's work on [topic] has advanced."

### When Your Fit Is Marginal

Not every job ad will be a perfect match. If you are considering applying to a position where the fit is not obvious, assess honestly:

- Can you make a genuine, non-strained argument for fit? If you have to contort your research description to match the ad, the fit is probably too thin.
- Does the ad language allow for breadth? Phrases like "area open" or "broadly trained" give you more room to argue for fit.
- Are there secondary qualifications you meet even if the primary focus is not your strength? For example, if the ad seeks a medical anthropologist but also values someone who can teach methods, and you have strong methods experience, that helps.
- Is the institution one where you would genuinely thrive? Applying to a position where you do not want to work wastes your time and the committee's.

## Tailoring by Position Type

### Tenure-Track R1

**Emphasis order**: Research, teaching, service

**Research section**: 40-50% of the letter body. Describe your research program in detail. Name publications by journal. Mention grants by funder and amount. Describe the book manuscript if applicable. Outline the next major project with specificity. Connect your work to the department's research strengths.

**Teaching section**: 25-30% of the letter body. Name courses you can teach, especially from the ad. Mention graduate mentoring experience or potential. Keep it substantive but proportionate.

**Service section**: 10-15%. Brief but present.

### Tenure-Track SLAC

**Emphasis order**: Teaching, research, service/collegiality

**Teaching section**: 40-50% of the letter body. Describe your pedagogical approach with specific examples. Name courses from the ad and describe how you would teach them. Propose new courses that fit the curriculum. Discuss advising, mentoring, and involving undergraduates in research. Address the liberal arts mission if applicable.

**Research section**: 25-30% of the letter body. Demonstrate an active research agenda that is sustainable at a teaching-intensive institution. Show how research involves undergraduates. Keep it accessible -- your research should sound exciting to someone outside your subfield.

**Service/collegiality section**: 15-20%. In a small department, this matters. Show you understand what it means to be a colleague in a 4-8 person department.

### Tenure-Track Balanced Institution

**Emphasis order**: Research and teaching roughly equal, then service

Both research and teaching must be strong. Neither can carry the other. Show integration where possible: how does your research inform your teaching? How does teaching generate new research questions?

### Postdoc

**Emphasis order**: Research, fit with host, mentoring potential

**Research section**: 60-70% of the letter. Focus on what you will accomplish during the postdoc. Show fit with the host lab, project, or center. Describe how the postdoc advances your research trajectory.

**Other sections**: Mention teaching and mentoring if relevant to the position. Some postdocs involve teaching; address it if so.

**Keep it shorter**: Postdoc cover letters can be 1-1.5 pages.

### VAP (Visiting Assistant Professor)

**Emphasis order**: Teaching, flexibility, collegiality

VAP positions need someone who can teach a range of courses competently and integrate smoothly into the department for 1-3 years. Lead with teaching breadth, name courses you can teach, and signal that you will be a low-maintenance colleague.

**Research**: Include briefly to show you are an active scholar, but teaching flexibility is the priority.

**Length**: 1-1.5 pages.

### Lecturer

**Emphasis order**: Teaching excellence and breadth

Lecturer positions prioritize teaching above all else. Describe your teaching experience in detail. Discuss course design, assessment, and innovation. Name a wide range of courses you can teach. Mention advising if applicable.

**Research**: Include only if the position description mentions it or if it informs your teaching.

**Length**: 1-1.5 pages.

## Common Cover Letter Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Generic letter sent to multiple institutions | Committee knows immediately; signals lack of interest | Tailor every letter. Reference specific department features. |
| Wrong institution name | Devastating error. Instant rejection in most cases. | Proofread. Search the document for other institution names. |
| Too long (over 2 pages) | Signals inability to write concisely or poor judgment | Edit ruthlessly. Two pages maximum for most positions. |
| Dissertation summary instead of research program | Makes you look like a one-project scholar | Frame research as a program with past, present, and future. |
| Abstract teaching claims | "I am passionate about teaching" without evidence is meaningless | Give specific examples: assignments, outcomes, innovations. |
| No evidence of fit | Could apply to any department in any institution | Reference specific courses, faculty, programs, mission. |
| Focusing on what you want | "This position would allow me to..." centers your needs | Focus on what you offer: "I would contribute to..." |
| Listing everything from the CV | The letter is not a prose version of the CV | Select strategically. Highlight the most relevant qualifications. |
| Underselling | Excessive hedging ("I hope to..." "I might be able to...") | State your qualifications with confidence. |
| Jargon overload | Not everyone on the committee is in your subfield | Write clearly enough for an anthropologist outside your area. |

## Addressing Gaps or Unusual Career Paths

If your career path includes elements that might raise questions, address them briefly and positively in the letter. Do not over-explain or apologize.

### Career Gap

One sentence: "After completing my MA, I spent three years working in international development, an experience that directly informs my research on NGO governance structures." This turns a gap into a qualification.

### Non-Traditional Path to Academia

Frame your prior experience as an asset: "My five years of UX research in the tech industry give me a unique perspective on digital anthropology and provide my students with practical examples of applied ethnographic methods."

### Changing Subfields or Regions

Explain the intellectual continuity: "While my doctoral work focused on South Asia, my postdoctoral research in East Africa extends the same theoretical questions about infrastructure and political belonging to a new context, allowing for productive comparison."

### ABD Status

Be clear about your timeline: "I expect to defend my dissertation in May 2025 and will have the PhD in hand before the start date." If you are ABD, the committee needs to know you will finish.

### Dual-Career Considerations

If you have a partner who also needs a position and the institution might accommodate a dual hire, this is generally not addressed in the cover letter. Dual-career conversations happen during the interview and negotiation stages, not in the application. Focus the letter entirely on your qualifications and fit.

### International Candidates

If you are applying from outside the country where the position is located, briefly note your eligibility to work (visa status, permanent residency, citizenship) in the closing paragraph if relevant. Do not make this a major focus -- lead with your qualifications. Many institutions have experience sponsoring work visas, but confirming your situation removes uncertainty for the committee.

## Length and Formatting

- **Length**: 1.5-2 pages for tenure-track positions. 1-1.5 pages for postdocs, VAPs, and lecturers. Never exceed 2 pages.
- **Font**: Match your CV font. 11-12 point.
- **Margins**: 1 inch.
- **Format**: Standard business letter format with date, addressee (search committee chair if named, otherwise "Members of the Search Committee"), salutation, body, closing, signature.
- **Salutation**: "Dear Members of the Search Committee" or "Dear Professor [Name]" if the chair is identified.
- **Closing**: "Sincerely" is standard. Include your typed name, department, and contact information.

- [ ] Letter reads as confident, not arrogant or desperate
- [ ] Closing mentions enclosed materials and availability

## Close Reading: Common Job Ad Phrases

Understanding what specific phrases in job ads actually signal helps you tailor your letter effectively.

**"We seek a scholar whose work addresses..."**: They have a specific intellectual direction. Your research must connect directly to this framing.

**"The successful candidate will teach..."**: These courses are required. Address each one in your letter.

**"Ability to contribute to [general education / core curriculum]"**: They need someone to teach intro courses. Do not treat intro teaching as beneath you.

**"Evidence of scholarly potential" (for ABD/early career)**: They know you are early in your career. Show a trajectory and plan, not just a dissertation.

**"Demonstrated record of research excellence" (for mid-career/senior)**: They expect substantial publications and grants. Your CV must back up what the letter claims.

**"Experience working with diverse student populations"**: Address this directly with specific examples from your teaching.

**"Interest in digital/computational/quantitative methods"**: Even if this is listed as a preference, addressing it strengthens your application. Show how these methods figure in your teaching or research.

**"The department is particularly interested in candidates who..."**: This is the most important sentence in the ad. Whatever follows it must be addressed prominently in your letter.

**"Salary commensurate with qualifications and experience"**: Standard language. Do not address salary in the cover letter. That conversation happens during negotiation.

**"Review of applications will begin [date]"**: This is effectively the deadline. Submit before this date. Applications received after may be considered if the pool is not strong, but do not count on it.

**"ABD candidates will be considered"**: They prefer a completed PhD but will look at advanced ABD candidates. If you are ABD, provide a clear, credible timeline for completion.

**"Position contingent upon funding"**: The position may not materialize. Apply anyway, but be aware.

## Tone and Voice

The cover letter should sound like a professional, confident version of your best self. It should not sound like a form letter, a personal essay, a plea, or a performance review.

### What Confidence Sounds Like

Confident: "My research demonstrates that water infrastructure projects in rural Tamil Nadu reconfigure local political relationships in ways that challenge top-down models of development."

Overconfident: "My groundbreaking research will transform how the field understands infrastructure and politics."

Underconfident: "I hope that my modest research on water infrastructure might potentially contribute to conversations about development."

Appropriate: "I am well-prepared to teach Introduction to Cultural Anthropology, having designed and taught the course twice with enrollments of 60-80 students."

Inappropriate: "I am, without question, the best instructor your department could hire for the intro course."

### Writing Process

1. Start with the job ad. Highlight every requirement and preference.
2. For each highlighted item, note what you can offer as evidence.
3. Draft the letter by section, using the architecture above.
4. Revise for specificity: replace every generic phrase with something tailored to this institution.
5. Revise for tone: remove hedging language and false modesty, but also remove grandiosity.
6. Check length: if over 2 pages, cut. Every sentence must earn its place.
7. Proofread for the institution name, position title, and any leftover language from letters to other institutions.
8. Have a trusted colleague read the letter for clarity and tone before submitting.
