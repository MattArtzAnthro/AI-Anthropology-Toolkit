# Method Modules

Definitions, comparative dimensions, and multi-method design patterns for the
14 method modules used in anthropological research methodology selection.

## The 14 Method Modules

1. **Participant observation and fieldnotes** — Prolonged immersion in social
   settings, producing fieldnotes as a disciplined analytic practice. Includes
   multi-sited variants.
2. **Semi-structured interviews** — Open-ended but guided conversations using
   an interview guide with probes. Includes life histories and oral history.
3. **Focus groups** — Moderated group discussions that reveal interactional
   consensus, contestation, and group norms.
4. **Document and media analysis** — Systematic analysis of textual and visual
   artifacts: policy documents, institutional texts, platform materials, media
   representations.
5. **Archival research** — Work with historical records, classificatory
   regimes, and past administrative practice. Includes "ethnography of the
   archive" approaches.
6. **Surveys and structured instruments** — Standardized measures administered
   across a sample, including mixed-methods integration with ethnography.
7. **Cognitive elicitation tasks and cultural consensus analysis** — Structured
   tasks (free lists, pilesorts, ranking) and formal models that reconstruct
   shared knowledge structures.
8. **Linguistic recording, transcription, and discourse/conversation
   analysis** — Audio/video capture of naturally occurring speech with
   systematic transcription and interactional analysis.
9. **Visual and sensory methods** — Photo elicitation, video, go-along
   methods, and sensory ethnography that access embodied and pre-reflective
   dimensions.
10. **Digital ethnography** — Embedded, embodied internet research treating
    online and offline practices as entangled. Platform observation and
    community engagement.
11. **Trace ethnography and documentary traces** — Analysis of logs, workflow
    artifacts, and documentary traces to reconstruct distributed coordination
    and processes.
12. **Computational text and network analysis** — NLP, topic modeling, network
    metrics, and other automated methods applied to large corpora. Requires
    explicit validation.
13. **Participatory and collaborative methods** — PAR, co-design, collaborative
    ethnography, and action-oriented approaches where stakeholders participate
    in research design and analysis.
14. **Rapid assessment and telescoped ethnography** — Team-based, triangulated
    approaches designed to yield credible findings under compressed timelines.

## Comparative Method Table

Each method module is characterized across six dimensions: evidence produced,
claims best supported, typical limitations, collection and analysis techniques,
ethical considerations, and time/resource intensity.

## Multi-Method Design Patterns

"Multi-method" is not a virtue by itself. It is defensible when the methods
form a system in which each component has a declared role and integration is
designed, not left as an aspiration.

### Pattern 1: Canonical Triad (Observation + Interviews + Documents)

**Rationale.** Observation captures practice and context; interviews elicit
frames and rationales; documents provide institutional categories and
public-facing representations that can be compared to practice and narrative.
This triad is often the default in interpretive and many critical projects
because it operationalizes practice-account-institution contrasts without
requiring incompatible claim forms.

**Integration strategy.** Use observation to build domain knowledge and refine
interview guides; use interviews to test interpretive hypotheses generated by
observation; use documents to trace category circulation and institutional
constraints, then return to observation/interviews to see how those categories
are enacted or resisted.

### Pattern 2: Ethnographic + Quantitative (Mixed Methods)

**Rationale.** Quantitative measures address distribution questions (how
common, where concentrated, correlated with what); ethnography explains
mechanisms of meaning, practice, and context. The state-of-the-art move is
to integrate early: ethnography can shape survey construction, rather than
being relegated to interpretation after the fact.

**Integration patterns.** Convergent designs merge qualitative and
quantitative evidence to produce joint inferences; sequential designs use one
strand to build or explain the other. Triangulation language is now more
persuasive when it specifies which kind of triangulation is being used (data,
method, theory) and what disagreement would imply, rather than treating
triangulation as automatic "validity."

### Pattern 3: Digital-Physical Hybrids

**Rationale.** When social life is mediated by the internet, "the field" is
multi-modal: embodied routines, platform interfaces, and social relationships
co-constitute practice. Digital ethnography treats online activity as embedded
and embodied; method systems therefore combine offline observation/interviews
with platform observation, screenshots, and where appropriate trace or
computational analysis.

**Ethics emphasis.** Hybrid designs must explicitly handle public/private
ambiguity, searchability, consent expectations, and the risks of storing and
sharing digital identifiers, using current internet ethics guidance.

### Pattern 4: Archival-Ethnographic Combinations

**Rationale.** Many anthropological questions require explaining how present
practices are historically produced. Archival work provides historical traces
and institutional memory; ethnography provides contemporary enactment and
interpretation. Stance alignment matters: critical and STS projects often
treat archival materials not only as "sources" but as artifacts of governance
and epistemic order.

**Integration strategy.** Use archives to specify timelines, category
histories, and institutional shifts; use ethnography to observe how these
histories surface in current practice; explicitly mark where the design is
inferential (linking past forms to present effects) versus descriptive.

### Pattern 5: Multi-Sited and Trace-Centered Designs

**Rationale.** Distributed phenomena require following connections rather than
assuming a single bounded site. Multi-sited ethnography and trace-based
approaches provide coherent ways to map associations across locations,
institutions, and infrastructures.

**Integration strategy.** "Follow the actors" (or the thing, the metaphor,
the conflict) across sites; use trace methods to reconstruct sequences of
practice that are distributed and not directly observable at any single site;
integrate with interviews to clarify how actors describe and contest the
connections being traced.
