### Legend

- **Standard (S):** Common and reviewer-legible within the stance family.
  Expected evidentiary moves. No special justification needed beyond
  connecting the method to the specific research question.
- **Coherent (C):** Epistemically compatible but not always expected. Requires
  explicit framing to avoid "category error" — explain why this method serves
  the stance's evidence needs in this particular project.
- **Innovative/defensible (I):** Less common in the stance family but
  justifiable with careful design, validation, and reflexive argumentation.
  Requires a clear statement of what the method contributes that standard
  methods cannot, and how its outputs will be validated within the stance's
  evidentiary norms.
- **High-tension (T):** Not "forbidden," but likely to be evaluated as
  incoherent unless the stance is explicitly adapted. Usually requires
  reframing claims (e.g., treating survey data as mapping structural exposure
  rather than measuring attitudes) or adding participatory governance. Flag
  these explicitly and explain the tension.

### Unspecified Family Template

For any stance not in the named families above, infer compatibility by
representing the stance along these dimensions:

- **Favored evidence:** practice, narrative, text, trace, number, material
- **Theory of causality or meaning:** interpretive, mechanistic, structural,
  relational
- **Politics of knowledge:** neutrality claims vs explicit critique/
  intervention
- **Researcher role:** observer, collaborator, advocate, designer, analyst

Then classify each method module by whether it produces the favored evidence
under the stance's validation norms (Standard), can do so with reframing
(Coherent), or requires substantial innovation (Innovative/defensible).

## Family-Specific Rationales

### Interpretive/Hermeneutic

Standard designs prioritize thick description and contextual interpretation.
Participant observation and open-ended interviews are central because they
capture meaning in situ and the gap between practice and account. Surveys or
computation become innovative/defensible when positioned as mapping the
distribution of meanings or identifying patterned variation that is then
interpreted ethnographically. Without that framing, they are often read as
importing a different claim model (measurement as if it were meaning).

### Phenomenological

The defining requirement is evidence that can speak to lived experience and
perception. In-depth interviewing is standard; go-alongs and sensory methods
are also standard because they elicit interpretation in context and can access
embodied or pre-reflective dimensions that sit poorly in abstract interviewing
alone. Structured instruments are typically high-tension unless the project
explicitly treats them as limited probes rather than as privileged measures
of experience.

### Critical/Political Economy

Ethnography is often paired with institutional documentation, policy analysis,
and historical or economic data because the stance treats power and structural
relations as objects of inquiry, not mere context. Surveys can be coherent if
they operationalize structural exposure (wages, hours, precarity measures)
and are integrated with ethnographic interpretation; they become weak when
used as stand-alone "proof" without linking measurement to theory of power.

### Feminist/Queer

Standard practice includes reflexive accounts of positionality and power in
the research encounter, explicit ethics, and in many projects collaborative
or participant-centered approaches. Digital and computational methods are
increasingly defensible within feminist and critical frames when they
explicitly analyze power in data infrastructures (who is counted, who is
harmed, what is rendered visible), and when governance, consent, and risk
are designed rather than presumed.

### STS/Actor-Network

"Follow the actors" and trace associations are core methodological moves.
Multi-sited observation, documentary tracing, and trace ethnography are
epistemically central, not ancillary. Interviews and observation remain
coherent, but they are typically framed as ways to map associations among
humans and nonhumans (documents, devices, infrastructures) rather than as
privileged access to "beliefs."

### Applied/Design

The stance is action-oriented: evidence must be usable for decisions, and
stakeholder engagement is often standard rather than optional. Rapid
assessment procedures and design ethnography are standard in many applied
settings because they are explicitly built to yield credible findings under
compressed timelines, often through teams, iterative cycles, and
triangulation.

### Cognitive/Psychological

Standard modules include structured elicitation tasks and formal models such
as cultural consensus analysis, because the stance aims to reconstruct shared
knowledge structures and quantify agreement/competence under explicit
assumptions. Ethnographic observation is often coherent as contextualization
and hypothesis generation, but the evidentiary center of gravity is typically
the task and model.

### Linguistic

Recording and transcription of naturally occurring speech, plus systematic
discourse analysis, is standard because language-in-use is the primary
evidence, not only people's reports about language. Interviews are coherent
for metalinguistic commentary (language ideologies, attitudes), but without
recordings they cannot support strong claims about interactional structure.

### Computational/Digital

Digital ethnography and trace methods are standard when the phenomenon is
platform-mediated. Computational text/network analysis is standard when the
research question involves large corpora or networked structure, but
state-of-the-art practice emphasizes that automated analysis is not a
substitute for careful conceptualization and requires problem-specific
validation.

## Justification Templates by Stance Family

Each template includes (a) a fill-in prose paragraph and (b) key argumentative
moves that reviewers typically need to see.

### Interpretive/Hermeneutic Template

**Exemplar prose:**
"Because this project examines meaning-making as a situated social practice,
I employ participant observation and semi-structured interviewing to produce
thick, contextual evidence of how [group] enact and interpret [phenomenon] in
everyday life. Sustained observation in [settings] documents interactional
routines, practical constraints, and tacit norms that are not fully accessible
through retrospective accounts alone; interviews then elicit participants'
interpretive frames, moral vocabularies, and narratives through which actions
are made sensible. I analyze fieldnotes and interview transcripts iteratively
to identify interpretive patterns and exceptions, and I use
[documents/platform texts] as a complementary record of publicly articulated
categories that participants may adopt, resist, or revise in practice."

**Key moves:** Thick description; practice-account gap; interpretive analysis;
bounded claims about meaning, not universal measurement.

### Phenomenological Template

**Exemplar prose:**
"This project is oriented to lived experience and perception in context. I
therefore use in-depth interviews complemented by go-along and sensory methods
to elicit accounts of [phenomenon] as it is encountered in the flow of daily
life. Go-alongs place interpretation in situ, enabling participants to narrate
sensations, micro-decisions, and affective responses that are difficult to
reconstruct abstractly. Analysis focuses on patterns in how experience is
structured and made meaningful, while remaining attentive to the limits of
language and the role of the research encounter in shaping description."

**Key moves:** In-situ elicitation; embodiment; limits of abstract
questioning; explicit reflexivity about mediation of experience.

### Critical/Political Economy Template

**Exemplar prose:**
"Because the research question involves relations of power and material
constraint, I use ethnographic methods alongside policy and institutional
analysis to connect everyday experience with the structural conditions that
shape it. Participant observation and interviews document how [actors]
navigate [institutional/market arrangements] in practice; analysis of
[policies/contracts/platform rules] specifies the formal and informal
mechanisms through which labor, risk, and value are distributed. The design
supports claims about how macro-level political-economic arrangements become
actionable in everyday life, while explicitly delimiting what can and cannot
be inferred from localized field sites."

**Key moves:** Linking micro practice to macro arrangements; documents as
mechanisms; explicit delimitation of structural inference.

### Feminist/Queer Template

**Exemplar prose:**
"This project treats knowledge production as situated and power-laden, and it
centers the experiences of [marginalized group] while interrogating the
conditions under which those experiences become legible. Accordingly, I
combine participant observation and interviews with collaborative practices
that allow participants to shape research priorities, categories, and
interpretations where feasible. I document positionality and the dynamics of
the research encounter as part of the evidence, and I design data governance
to reduce risks associated with recording, storage, and circulation. Where
computational or documentary sources are used, they are analyzed as
infrastructures of visibility and exclusion rather than neutral reflections
of reality."

**Key moves:** Situated knowledges; standpoint and power; collaboration;
ethics as method; critique of data infrastructures.

### STS/Actor-Network Template

**Exemplar prose:**
"To understand how [phenomenon] is assembled across humans, technologies, and
documents, I adopt a 'follow-the-actors' strategy. I combine multi-sited
observation with documentary and trace analysis to map associations among
[people], [devices], [records], and [categories], treating these heterogeneous
elements as constitutive of the social rather than as background. Interviews
are used to clarify how actors describe and contest associations, while trace
and document analysis reconstructs sequences of practice that are distributed
across sites and infrastructures."

**Key moves:** Tracing associations; heterogeneity; multi-sited design
rationale; traces as action, not merely records.

### Applied/Design Template

**Exemplar prose:**
"The goal of this project is to produce empirically credible findings that can
inform decisions in [setting]. I therefore use a rapid, iterative, and
triangulated design combining short-cycle observation, targeted interviewing,
stakeholder workshops, and where appropriate lightweight structured
instruments. Iterative cycles allow early findings to reshape sampling and
instruments, and triangulation tests whether program-relevant explanations
hold across methods. The design produces evidence both about what is happening
and about which interventions are feasible in this context."

**Key moves:** Actionability; telescoped but rigorous cycles; explicit
triangulation logic; deliverables for stakeholders.

### Cognitive/Psychological Template

**Exemplar prose:**
"This project aims to model shared knowledge and variation in competence
regarding [domain]. I therefore use structured elicitation tasks and cultural
consensus analysis to estimate patterns of agreement and identify dimensions
of cultural knowledge. Ethnographic observation and open-ended interviewing
are used to define culturally meaningful domains and interpret task results,
but the primary evidentiary claims are grounded in formal models of informant
accuracy under explicit assumptions."

**Key moves:** Tasks as primary evidence; explicit assumptions; ethnography
as domain grounding and interpretation.

### Linguistic Template

**Exemplar prose:**
"Because the unit of analysis is language-in-use, the core evidence in this
project is recorded interaction. I therefore collect audio/video in [settings],
produce systematic transcripts, and analyze interactional structure and
indexical meaning through discourse and conversation analytic techniques.
Interviews are used selectively for metalinguistic commentary and language
ideologies, but claims about communicative practice are grounded in recorded
interaction rather than in retrospective description alone."

**Key moves:** Recorded speech as primary evidence; transcription as method;
delimiting when interviews are sufficient.

### Computational/Digital Template

**Exemplar prose:**
"This project treats platform-mediated activity as both a cultural practice
and a source of documentary traces. I combine digital ethnography with trace
and computational analysis to connect situated meaning with large-scale
patterns. Trace data provide visibility into distributed activity that is
otherwise costly or inaccessible to observe directly; computational
text/network methods characterize patterns at scale, but their outputs are
validated through close reading, qualitative interpretation, and direct
engagement with participants. Ethical decisions about data collection, storage,
and publication follow current internet research guidance, including attention
to the public/private ambiguity and searchability of digital identifiers."

**Key moves:** Scale plus depth; validation; trace interpretation; explicit
internet ethics.

## Worked Examples

All three examples use the same research question to show how stance changes
the method system:

**Shared research question:** "How do gig workers make meaning out of
algorithmic management and economic precarity in their everyday work and life
planning?"

### Interpretive/Hermeneutic Version

**Method system:** Participant observation (ride-alongs and waiting spaces),
semi-structured interviews, document analysis (platform communications,
training materials, worker forums as texts), iterative qualitative analysis.

**Justification:** This study treats gig work not only as an economic
arrangement but as a lived cultural world in which workers interpret
algorithmic management, risk, and autonomy through locally meaningful
categories. To produce thick, contextual evidence of meaning-making in
practice, I will conduct participant observation with workers across the
settings where work is organized and experienced (vehicle/workspace routines,
waiting zones, online scheduling interactions), documenting how decisions are
made, how uncertainty is handled, and how moral and practical judgments are
enacted. Semi-structured interviews will then elicit the interpretive frames
through which workers narrate "flexibility," dignity, surveillance, and
responsibility, allowing comparison between enacted practice and
retrospective accounts. Finally, analysis of platform documents and
communications provides the publicly articulated categories that workers
encounter and reinterpret, enabling a grounded account of how institutional
texts become meaningful in everyday life.

### Computational/Digital Version

**Method system:** Digital ethnography (platform-mediated practices and worker
communities), trace ethnography (forum histories, policy change logs),
computational text analysis of worker discussions and platform communications,
plus targeted interviews for ground truth and interpretation.

**Justification:** Because algorithmic management operates through a
combination of interface design, platform rules, and distributed traces of
activity, this project requires evidence that is both situated and scalable.
I therefore combine digital ethnography with trace and computational methods.
Digital ethnography documents how workers navigate platform interfaces and
communities in real time, treating online and offline practices as entangled
rather than separable domains. Trace ethnography leverages documentary traces
(time-stamped policy updates, forum histories, workflow artifacts) to
reconstruct how rules and worker strategies change over time in ways that are
difficult to observe directly in a single field site. Computational text
analysis then characterizes recurring patterns and shifts across a large
corpus of worker discussions and platform communications, while explicitly
validating model outputs through close reading and through interviews that
clarify how workers interpret and deploy key categories. Ethical decisions
about data collection and publication follow current internet research
guidance, including attention to consent expectations, searchability of
identifiers, and the risk profile of the population.

### Feminist/Critical Version

**Method system:** Participant observation plus interviews, supplemented by
collaborative/participatory components (co-designed interview domains or
member feedback sessions), document/policy analysis (contracts, wage policies,
labor regulations), and an explicit data governance plan; optional critical
analysis of platform metrics and categories.

**Justification:** This study approaches gig work as a gendered and raced
political economy in which "what counts" is itself an effect of power.
Knowledge is treated as situated and produced within unequal relations,
including the research encounter; consequently, method choices must both
generate evidence and govern its ethical and political implications. I combine
participant observation and interviews to document how workers experience and
interpret algorithmic management, while also attending to the interactional
conditions under which accounts are produced (positionality, safety, and the
risks of disclosure). Where feasible, collaborative practices will be used to
shape question domains and interpretive categories, so that analysis does not
simply impose researcher framings on precarious lives. Policy and document
analysis specifies the institutional mechanisms through which risk and value
are distributed (contracts, wage rules, classification regimes), allowing
ethnographic accounts to be linked to the structural conditions that shape
them. Finally, data governance is designed as part of method: consent is
treated as ongoing, materials are stored and shared under negotiated
custodianship expectations, and publication choices prioritize reducing
re-identification and future harms.
