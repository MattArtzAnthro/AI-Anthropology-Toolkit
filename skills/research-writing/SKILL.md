# Research Writing for Anthropology

Write research articles, thesis chapters, and dissertation chapters for
anthropology that make a clear argument grounded in evidence, follow
disciplinary conventions, and meet journal or committee expectations.
Anthropological research writing is simultaneously an analytical act and a
craft practice: the structure of the article is itself an argument about how
evidence, theory, and interpretation relate.

The central challenge of anthropological writing is balancing descriptive
richness with analytical clarity. Ethnographic articles must provide enough
contextual detail for the reader to see the world the researcher encountered,
while making explicit what that world reveals about broader patterns, processes,
or problems. Too much description without analysis produces travelogue; too
much theory without evidence produces abstraction. The best anthropological
writing integrates both at the sentence level, not just the section level.

This skill handles the full range of research writing tasks: from outlining a
complete article to drafting individual sections to revising existing drafts.
It adapts to subfield conventions — cultural anthropology's vignette-led
narratives differ from archaeology's hypothesis-driven reports — while
maintaining shared standards of argumentative clarity and evidentiary rigor.

**Cross-references:** For responding to peer review and writing rebuttal
letters, use the [academic-review](../academic-review/) skill. For conference
abstracts and presentations, use the
[conference-materials](../conference-materials/) skill.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify What the User Needs

Determine the entry point:

- **Writing a full article from scratch.** The user has data and needs to
  produce a complete manuscript. Load the article-architecture-guide for
  structure and the subfield-conventions-guide for disciplinary norms. Work
  through sections sequentially or in the user's preferred order.
- **Writing a specific section.** The user needs help with one section
  (introduction, methods, findings, etc.). Load the article-architecture-guide
  for that section's guidance and the writing-craft-guide for style.
- **Writing a thesis or dissertation chapter.** Similar to an article but
  longer, with different audience (committee) and scope. Load the
  article-architecture-guide and use the thesis adaptation sections.
- **Revising an existing draft.** The user has a draft and needs to improve
  it. Identify which sections need work, load relevant references, and focus
  on specific weaknesses.
- **Writing a literature review section.** In anthropology, literature review
  is typically integrated into the introduction and discussion rather than
  standalone. Load the writing-craft-guide for literature integration
  guidance.
- **Adapting for a specific journal.** The user is targeting a particular
  journal and needs format and convention guidance. Load the
  subfield-conventions-guide for journal-specific requirements.

### Step 2: Gather Context

Before generating any content, collect these inputs:

**Required:**
1. **Research topic and argument.** What is the paper about, and what does it
   argue? Push for specificity: "This paper argues that X reveals Y" rather
   than "This paper is about X."
2. **Methods and evidence.** What data does the user have? Ethnographic
   fieldwork, interviews, archival material, archaeological data, biological
   measurements? The type of evidence shapes the article structure.
3. **Subfield.** Cultural, linguistic, medical, biological, archaeological, or
   applied anthropology? Each has distinct conventions for structure, voice,
   evidence presentation, and theory use.

**Important but can be inferred:**
4. **Target journal or venue.** AAA flagship, regional, interdisciplinary, or
   specialty journal? Thesis/dissertation for a specific committee? This
   determines word limits, format, and audience expectations.
5. **Article type.** Empirical/ethnographic (most common), theoretical,
   methods-focused, or review article. Each has a different structural logic.
6. **Document stage.** Outline, first draft, revision, or final polish.
   Earlier stages need more structural guidance; later stages need more craft
   and precision.
7. **Career stage.** Graduate student, early career, or senior scholar. Affects
   the scope of claims and rhetorical positioning.

**Helpful but not required:**
- Specific theoretical framework or key interlocutors
- Word count target or page limit
- Whether visuals (maps, photos, figures, tables) will be included
- Prior feedback from advisors, reviewers, or writing groups
- Timeline and deadline pressures

### Step 3: Load Appropriate References

- **Always load** `references/article-architecture-guide.md` for structural
  guidance. This is the primary reference for any writing task.
- **Load** `references/subfield-conventions-guide.md` when the user is working
  in a specific subfield or targeting a specific journal, or when the writing
  task involves adapting between subfield conventions.
- **Load** `references/writing-craft-guide.md` when the user needs help with
  style, voice, ethnographic description, literature integration, citation
  formatting, or ethics statements.
- **Load all three** for full article drafts, thesis chapters, or when the
  user is uncertain about conventions.

### Step 4: Generate Content

Follow the article architecture from the guide reference. The standard
anthropological research article contains these sections (adapt order and
emphasis to subfield):

1. **Title and keywords** — concise, keyword-rich, signaling the argument
2. **Abstract** — 100-150 words summarizing purpose, methods, findings,
   contribution; no citations
3. **Introduction** — hook (often ethnographic vignette), research question,
   literature positioning, thesis statement, article roadmap
4. **Literature and theory** — integrated into introduction and/or standalone
   section; positions the study within ongoing scholarly conversations
5. **Methods** — field site, duration, participants, data collection,
   analytical approach, reflexivity, ethics
6. **Findings/results** — thematic sections with evidence (quotes, fieldnotes,
   data); organized by analytical themes, not chronology
7. **Discussion** — interpretation, connection to theory and literature,
   limitations, broader significance
8. **Conclusion** — core contribution restated, implications, future
   directions

For thesis/dissertation chapters: adapt section proportions (longer literature
engagement, more methodological detail, committee-oriented framing), and
consider how the chapter fits the larger document arc.

### Step 5: Generate Output

Produce one or more deliverables depending on user needs:

- **Full article outline.** Section-by-section plan with argument thread,
  evidence allocation, and word count targets per section.
- **Complete article draft.** Full manuscript following disciplinary
  conventions, calibrated to journal and subfield.
- **Individual section draft.** Any single section (abstract, introduction,
  methods, findings, discussion, conclusion) as a standalone deliverable.
- **Thesis/dissertation chapter.** Adapted for committee audience, longer
  format, and integration with the larger document.
- **Section revision.** Targeted improvements to an existing section, with
  specific suggestions for strengthening argument, evidence, or prose.
- **Literature review integration.** Guidance on weaving literature into the
  article rather than producing a standalone review.
- **Structural outline.** Article architecture showing how argument, evidence,
  and theory connect across sections.

### Step 6: Quality Check

Before presenting output, verify:

- [ ] The article has a clear, stated argument — not just a topic
- [ ] Each section serves its specific function (introduction hooks and frames;
      methods establishes credibility; findings present evidence; discussion
      interprets)
- [ ] Evidence and analysis are integrated, not separated into description-
      then-interpretation blocks
- [ ] Participant voice is used with context (who said it, when, why it
      matters) not as decoration
- [ ] Literature is engaged analytically (positioned, synthesized, challenged)
      not just cited
- [ ] The introduction and conclusion align — the contribution promised in the
      introduction is delivered in the conclusion
- [ ] Subfield conventions are followed (vignette opening for cultural;
      hypothesis for bioanthro; material description for archaeology)
- [ ] Word count is appropriate for the target venue
- [ ] Ethics statement is included (IRB, consent, confidentiality)
- [ ] Citations follow author-date format consistently
- [ ] No section is doing another section's work (findings don't contain
      discussion; discussion doesn't introduce new evidence)
- [ ] Transitions between sections are explicit — the reader always knows
      where the argument is going

## Parameters

- **Output type:** Full article draft, individual section, thesis chapter,
  article outline, section revision, literature integration. Determines scope
  and depth of output.
- **Subfield:** Cultural, linguistic, medical, biological, archaeological,
  applied. Each subfield has distinct conventions for structure, voice,
  evidence, and theory. See subfield-conventions-guide for details.
- **Journal target:** AAA flagship (American Ethnologist, American
  Anthropologist, Cultural Anthropology), regional journal, interdisciplinary
  outlet, specialty journal (Medical Anthropology Quarterly, Journal of
  Linguistic Anthropology, Journal of Archaeological Science). Determines word
  limits, format, and audience expectations.
- **Document stage:** Outline, first draft, revision, final polish. Earlier
  stages need structural guidance; later stages need craft refinement.
- **Article type:** Empirical/ethnographic (field data + analysis),
  theoretical (argument-driven with illustrative evidence), methods-focused
  (methodological contribution), review article (synthetic overview of a
  field). Each has different structural logic and section proportions.

## Guardrails

- **Every article must have an argument, not just a topic.** "This paper
  examines X" is insufficient. Push for "This paper argues that X reveals Y"
  or "This paper demonstrates that X challenges Y." If the user cannot
  articulate an argument, help them develop one before drafting.
- **Do not separate description from analysis.** Ethnographic writing
  integrates evidence and interpretation at the paragraph level. A findings
  section that presents quotes without analysis, or a discussion that
  theorizes without evidence, is a structural failure.
- **Adapt to subfield conventions.** A cultural anthropology article that
  reads like an archaeology lab report, or vice versa, will be rejected. Load
  the subfield-conventions-guide and follow disciplinary norms for structure,
  voice, evidence presentation, and theory engagement.
- **Literature review is analytical, not encyclopedic.** The goal is to
  position your study within ongoing conversations, not to demonstrate
  exhaustive reading. Every cited work should serve the argument: establishing
  a gap, providing a framework, or identifying a debate your evidence
  addresses.
- **Participant voice requires context.** Quotes from interviews or fieldnotes
  must be introduced (who, when, where) and followed by analysis (what this
  reveals). A quote dropped into text without framing is evidence without
  argument.
- **Do not fabricate data, quotes, or citations.** Use clear placeholders
  (e.g., "[Participant, interview, date]", "[Author Year]") when the user has
  not provided specific content.
- **Ethics statements are required, not optional.** Every article should
  include IRB/ethics approval, consent process, and confidentiality measures.
  If the user has not mentioned these, prompt for them.
- **Thesis chapters are not just longer articles.** They require more
  extensive literature engagement, methodological justification, and
  integration with the larger dissertation argument. Adapt accordingly.
- **Route peer review tasks to the correct skill.** If the user asks about
  responding to reviewer feedback or writing a rebuttal letter, direct them
  to the academic-review skill.

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure mode | Prevention |
|---|---|
| Topic description without argument ("this paper examines...") | Require an explicit contribution statement before drafting; push for "argues that," "demonstrates," or "reveals" |
| Description-analysis separation (all quotes in findings, all theory in discussion) | Integrate evidence and interpretation within each section; every ethnographic passage should be followed by analytical commentary |
| Literature review as annotated bibliography (X said A, Y said B, Z said C) | Synthesize: group sources by argument or debate, not by author; show how your study enters the conversation |
| Introduction that buries the argument on page 5 | State the thesis or research question within the first 1-2 pages; the vignette hooks but the argument grounds |
| Methods section that reads as autobiography | Focus on what the reader needs to evaluate the evidence: site, duration, methods, sample, analytical approach, reflexivity; not a personal narrative of fieldwork challenges |
| Findings organized chronologically instead of analytically | Organize by themes or analytical categories, not by "first I did X, then Y"; chronology serves description, themes serve argument |
| Conclusion that introduces new evidence or arguments | Conclusions restate and extend; new data or claims belong in findings or discussion |
| Ignoring subfield conventions | Load subfield-conventions-guide; a cultural anthro paper without ethnographic voice or an archaeology paper without material description will be rejected |

## Examples

**Example 1: Full ethnographic article for American Ethnologist**

Input: "I need to write a full article for American Ethnologist based on my
fieldwork on water governance in coastal Tamil Nadu. I spent 14 months doing
participant observation with fishing communities and state water bureaucrats.
My argument is that fishers' water knowledge constitutes a form of hydro-
political expertise that state planners systematically devalue."

Output approach:
- Load all three reference files
- Set subfield to cultural anthropology, journal to AAA flagship, article
  type to empirical/ethnographic
- Word target: 8,000-10,000 words (AE standard)
- Structure: opening vignette (a specific encounter between a fisher and a
  bureaucrat that crystallizes the tension), introduction with argument and
  literature positioning (political ecology, knowledge politics, South Asian
  water studies), brief methods paragraph (14 months, two sites, participant
  observation + interviews), 3 thematic findings sections (fisher knowledge
  practices, bureaucratic knowledge hierarchies, moments of encounter/
  dismissal), discussion connecting to theory, conclusion with implications
- Voice: first-person ethnographic, reflexive, vignette-rich
- Draft section by section, beginning with findings (where the evidence is
  strongest) then framing introduction and discussion around the findings

**Example 2: Methods section for a medical anthropology article**

Input: "I'm revising my methods section for Medical Anthropology Quarterly.
Reviewers said it's too vague. I did 10 months of fieldwork in a maternal
health clinic in Nairobi, interviewed 45 women and 12 health workers, and
observed daily clinic operations. I used grounded theory for analysis."

Output approach:
- Load article-architecture-guide (methods section) and writing-craft-guide
  (ethics statements)
- Set subfield to medical anthropology, journal to specialty
- Methods section should specify: field site and access (how entry was
  negotiated), timeframe (10 months, dates), participant recruitment and
  sampling strategy, data collection methods (participant observation hours/
  frequency, interview format/duration/language, any recording), analytical
  approach (grounded theory — specify which variant, coding process, how
  themes emerged), reflexivity (researcher positionality relative to
  participants), ethics (IRB approval, consent process, confidentiality
  measures including pseudonyms)
- Address reviewer concern directly: replace vague language ("I conducted
  interviews") with specific detail ("I conducted 45 semi-structured
  interviews averaging 60 minutes with women attending antenatal and
  postnatal clinics, recruited through...")

**Example 3: Thesis chapter outline for archaeology dissertation**

Input: "I need to outline my third dissertation chapter — it's about the
faunal analysis from my excavation at a Late Bronze Age site in Cyprus. I have
animal bone data from 6 contexts and I'm arguing that feasting practices
varied by social status based on bone assemblage composition."

Output approach:
- Load article-architecture-guide (thesis adaptation) and
  subfield-conventions-guide (archaeology)
- Set subfield to archaeology, document type to thesis chapter, article type
  to empirical
- Chapter structure (longer than article, ~12,000-15,000 words): introduction
  restating dissertation argument and this chapter's contribution,
  archaeological context (site, chronology, excavation history), methods
  (faunal analysis protocols, identification criteria, quantification methods,
  taphonomic considerations), results organized by context (6 assemblages
  with tables and figures for each: NISP, MNI, body part representation,
  species composition), comparative analysis across contexts (the analytical
  core: how assemblages differ by status-associated contexts), discussion
  connecting to feasting literature and Bronze Age social organization,
  chapter conclusion linking back to the dissertation's larger argument
- Voice: third-person, technical, data-rich with tables and figures
- Emphasize: every table and figure must be referenced in text; interpretation
  follows data presentation within each section
