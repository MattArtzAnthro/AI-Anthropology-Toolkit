# Writing Craft Guide for Anthropological Research

This reference covers the craft dimensions of anthropological writing: style, voice,
ethnographic description, participant quotes, literature integration, citations, ethics,
and visuals. It is designed as a companion to the structural and formatting guides in
this toolkit.

## Style and Voice

Anthropological writing values clarity, nuance, and variety. The best ethnographic prose
reads as both rigorous and engaging, carrying analytical weight without sacrificing
readability. Good anthropological writing does not sound like a bureaucratic report or a
novel; it occupies a distinctive register that balances precision with narrative flow.

### Sentence Craft

Vary sentence length deliberately. Short sentences land analytical points. Longer
sentences build context, layer description, and carry the reader through complex
relationships between actors, structures, and meanings. Alternating between the two
creates rhythm and prevents monotony.

Use punctuation purposefully. Em dashes set off asides that deserve emphasis. Semicolons
link closely related ideas without the full stop of a period. Colons introduce
explanations or lists. Parentheses de-emphasize supplementary information. Each mark
shapes how the reader processes the sentence.

### Active and Passive Voice

Active voice is generally preferred because it clarifies who is doing what. "Women
organized the ceremony" is stronger and more informative than "The ceremony was
organized." However, passive voice serves specific purposes in ethnographic writing:

- **De-centering the researcher**: "Interviews were conducted" shifts attention away from
  the anthropologist when the focus should be on participants or processes.
- **Emphasizing the subject**: "The village was relocated by government order" foregrounds
  the village and the experience of displacement rather than the government actors.
- **Disciplinary convention**: Methods sections sometimes use passive voice by convention,
  though this is changing.

Use passive voice intentionally, not by default. If you cannot identify a reason for the
passive construction, rewrite it in active voice.

### First-Person Usage

"I" is increasingly standard in ethnographic writing. First-person signals reflexivity,
acknowledges the researcher's presence in the field, and avoids the false objectivity of
constructions like "the researcher observed." Many contemporary ethnographers use "I"
freely when describing fieldwork, analytical reasoning, and positionality.

That said, journal norms vary. Some journals in biological anthropology and archaeology
still prefer third person or limited first-person usage. Check recent issues of your
target journal. When in doubt, use first person for fieldwork narration and positionality
statements, and a more impersonal register for methods and results.

### Technical Language

Avoid jargon unless it is essential to your argument. When a technical term is necessary,
define it on first use. Do not assume the reader shares your theoretical vocabulary,
especially when writing for a general anthropology audience rather than a subfield
journal.

Terms like "habitus," "biopower," "ontological turn," or "assemblage" carry specific
analytical weight, but they become empty signifiers when deployed without explanation.
If a concept does real work in your analysis, invest the space to explain it. If it does
not, cut it.

### Tentativeness and Hedging

Words like "suggests," "indicates," and "reveals" are valuable tentativeness markers when
used deliberately. Ethnographic evidence rarely proves anything in the positivist sense;
it suggests, illuminates, and complicates. Appropriate hedging signals intellectual
honesty.

However, excessive hedging undermines your argument. If every sentence contains "perhaps,"
"might," "seems to," or "it could be argued that," the reader loses confidence in your
claims. State your interpretations with conviction when the evidence supports them.
Reserve hedging for genuinely uncertain or contested claims.

### Authorial Presence in Contemporary Ethnography

The discipline has shifted substantially from the era of "objective distance" and the
omniscient narrator. Contemporary ethnography acknowledges the author as a situated,
partial observer whose positionality shapes what they see and how they interpret it. This
does not mean every paper becomes a memoir. It means the writing does not pretend the
analyst is absent from the analysis.

This shift shows up in sentence-level choices: using "I" rather than "the researcher,"
acknowledging moments of confusion or reinterpretation, naming your social position when
it is relevant to the analysis.

### Register Calibration

Match your formality to the journal and subfield. A piece for American Ethnologist will
read differently from one in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology. Medical
anthropology journals often bridge clinical and ethnographic registers. Archaeological
writing tends toward a more technical, data-driven tone.

Read five recent articles in your target journal before drafting. Absorb the register,
the sentence structures, the balance of evidence and interpretation.

### Common Style Problems

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Nominalization (using noun forms of verbs: "the implementation of" instead of "they implemented") | Convert back to verb form for directness |
| Stacked prepositional phrases ("the role of women in the context of the transformation of...") | Break into shorter sentences; restructure |
| Throat-clearing openings ("It is important to note that...") | Delete the throat-clearing; start with the point |
| Overuse of "this" without a referent ("This shows that...") | Specify: "This pattern shows..." or "This contradiction reveals..." |
| Scare quotes around common terms ("the 'community' was...") | Use scare quotes only when genuinely problematizing a term |
| Adverb clutter ("very," "really," "extremely," "quite") | Cut or replace with a more precise adjective |
| Unclear pronoun reference (ambiguous "they," "it," "which") | Name the referent explicitly |
| Inconsistent tense (shifting between past and present without reason) | Choose a tense logic and maintain it |
| Sentence fragments in formal prose | Reserve fragments for deliberate rhetorical effect only |
| Run-on sentences joining unrelated ideas | Split into separate sentences with clear logical connections |

## Ethnographic Writing Craft

### Thick Description

Thick description, following Clifford Geertz, means richly contextualized narratives that
convey cultural meaning rather than mere surface behavior. A thin description records what
happened. A thick description explains what it meant, to whom, and within what web of
significance.

Description IS analysis when done well. The choice of what details to include, how to
frame a scene, and which sensory or social elements to foreground all reflect
interpretive decisions. A well-crafted descriptive passage does not merely set up
analysis; it enacts it.

### Ethnographic Vignettes

Vignettes are self-contained scenes that crystallize a larger pattern. They are among the
most powerful tools in ethnographic writing. A strong vignette has four elements:

1. **Setting**: Where and when the scene takes place, with enough spatial and temporal
   detail to ground the reader.
2. **Action**: What happens, rendered with specificity and pacing.
3. **Dialogue or voice**: What people say, in their own words when possible.
4. **Analytical point**: What the scene reveals about the broader argument, stated
   explicitly or implied through the description.

Place vignettes at the opening of a section or chapter to draw the reader in, or at a
pivot point where the analysis shifts direction.

### Scene-Setting

Good scene-setting uses spatial, temporal, and sensory detail to place the reader in the
field. Where are we? What time of day is it? What does the space look, sound, smell like?
Who is present, and what are they doing?

Avoid generic descriptions. "The clinic was busy" tells the reader nothing specific.
Instead: describe the waiting room, the number of people, the sounds, the temperature,
the particular quality of waiting that characterizes this place.

### Character Development

Introduce key participants as complex social actors, not as data sources or case studies.
Give them (pseudonymous) names. Describe their situations, their concerns, their ways of
speaking. Let the reader understand them as people before asking the reader to see them
as evidence of a pattern.

Return to the same participants across sections when possible. This builds narrative
continuity and allows the reader to see how a single person's experience illuminates
multiple dimensions of your analysis.

### Narrative Arc Within Sections

Each section of an ethnographic article should build toward an analytical insight through
accumulated detail. Open with a scene or observation. Layer evidence. Introduce
complications or contrasts. Arrive at the analytical point with the weight of the
evidence behind it.

This does not mean burying the argument. State your section's claim early, then use
the narrative to substantiate and deepen it.

### Temporal vs. Thematic Organization

**Temporal organization** works when the sequence of events matters to the argument:
processes of change, unfolding crises, life histories, ritual progressions. It creates
natural narrative momentum.

**Thematic organization** works when you are analyzing dimensions of a phenomenon that do
not follow a chronological logic: structural forces, competing discourses, layers of
meaning. Most ethnographic articles use thematic organization for the analysis sections.

Many strong articles combine both: a chronological frame at the macro level with thematic
organization within sections.

### The Zoom Technique

Move between close-up detail and analytical distance within a single paragraph. Begin
with a concrete observation, pull back to contextualize it within broader patterns or
structures, then return to the specific. This oscillation between scales is a hallmark
of strong ethnographic prose.

### Showing vs. Telling

Let the evidence demonstrate the point before stating the interpretation explicitly.
If a vignette effectively conveys the tension between state policy and local practice,
the reader should feel that tension before you name it analytically. Show first, then
tell. The showing makes the telling convincing.

### Balancing Description and Analysis

The paragraph is the unit where description and analysis meet. A common and effective
structure: open with a descriptive or evidentiary sentence or two, then pivot to
analytical commentary that explains what the description reveals. Neither pure
description nor pure analysis sustains an article on its own.

## Using Participant Voice

### The Role of Quotes

Direct quotes from interviews and fieldnotes are a hallmark of ethnographic writing. They
bring participant perspectives into the text, ground claims in lived experience, and give
the reader access to local meanings and idioms. However, quotes are evidence, not
argument. They require framing and interpretation.

### When to Quote

Quote when a participant's own words capture something that paraphrase would flatten:

- **Key expressions**: Local terms, idioms, or phrases that carry cultural meaning.
- **Local meanings**: How participants define, categorize, or explain their own
  experience.
- **Crystallizing moments**: Statements that encapsulate a broader pattern with unusual
  clarity or force.

Do not quote routine or unremarkable statements that could be paraphrased without loss.

### Introducing Quotes

Every quote needs context. Before the quote, tell the reader who is speaking, in what
situation, and why it matters. A bare quote dropped into a paragraph without introduction
disorients the reader.

Effective introductions are brief but informative: "Maria, a nurse who had worked in the
clinic for twelve years, described the change bluntly:" This tells the reader who is
speaking, what gives their perspective authority, and prepares the reader for the tone.

### Analyzing Quotes

Every quote should be followed by analytical commentary explaining what it reveals.
Do not let a quote stand alone as if its meaning is self-evident. Even when a quote
seems to speak for itself, your job as the analyst is to connect it to the broader
argument.

The pattern is: introduction, quote, analysis. This three-part structure ensures that
participant voice and analytical voice work together.

### Formatting Conventions

**Short quotes** (fewer than three lines) are integrated inline with quotation marks:
As Maria explained, "We stopped trusting the supply chain after 2015."

**Block quotes** for longer passages are indented and set apart from the main text,
typically without quotation marks. Introduce a block quote with a complete sentence
ending in a colon. Follow it immediately with analytical commentary.

**Fieldnote excerpts** should be visually distinguished from interview quotes. Common
conventions include italics, a different indentation style, or an explicit label such
as "Fieldnote, March 12, 2022." This distinction matters because fieldnotes represent
the researcher's observations, while interview quotes represent participant speech.

### Dangers to Avoid

- **Over-quoting**: Letting participants do the analytical work. If your article reads
  as a series of quotes strung together with minimal commentary, you have abdicated
  your role as analyst.
- **Under-analyzing**: Treating a quote as self-explanatory. Even powerful quotes need
  interpretation.
- **De-contextualizing**: Presenting a quote without sufficient information about who
  said it, when, and in what situation.

### Translation

When working across languages, note the original language and your translation approach.
Some authors include the original-language term in parentheses after the English
translation when a term carries meanings that the translation does not fully capture.
If you used a translator or research assistant, acknowledge their role.

### Attribution Ethics

Use pseudonyms consistently. When a quote could identify a participant despite a
pseudonym (because of their role, location, or the specificity of their experience),
consider whether to use the quote at all or to further anonymize by altering
identifying details. Some researchers use composite characters, combining statements
from multiple participants; if you do this, disclose it transparently.

## Literature Integration

### Weaving vs. Standalone Literature Review

In cultural and medical anthropology, literature is typically woven into the introduction
and discussion sections rather than presented as a standalone review. The introduction
establishes the scholarly conversation your study enters. The discussion returns to that
conversation with your findings in hand.

In archaeology and biological anthropology, a standalone literature review or background
section is more common, often organized around specific debates, methods, or regional
sequences.

### Synthesizing, Not Summarizing

Group sources by argument, debate, or theme rather than by author. A literature review
that reads as a series of summaries ("Smith (2020) argues... Jones (2019) found...
Williams (2021) claims...") fails to synthesize. Instead, identify the positions in a
debate and cite multiple authors in support of each position.

### The Conversation Metaphor

Think of your literature review as entering an ongoing scholarly conversation. Who has
been speaking? What are they debating? Where do they agree, and where do they diverge?
Your study is your contribution to this conversation, and the literature review explains
what has already been said so the reader understands why your contribution matters.

### Identifying the Gap

Every literature review should arrive at a gap: something that has not been said, asked,
examined, or shown. This gap is what your study addresses. The gap should emerge naturally
from the synthesis, not be announced abruptly.

Common gap types: a population not studied, a context not examined, a theoretical
connection not made, a method not applied, a contradiction not resolved.

### Theory as Analytical Tool

Every theoretical concept introduced in the literature review should do work in the
analysis. If a theory appears in the introduction but never resurfaces in the findings
or discussion, it does not belong in the paper. Theory is not decoration; it is a lens
that shapes how you interpret your data.

### How Much to Cite

Cite enough to position your study within the relevant debates and demonstrate your
command of the field. Do not cite so much that the reader loses your argument in a forest
of references. A focused review of the most relevant work is stronger than an exhaustive
catalog.

### Engaging with Disagreement

Fairly represent scholars whose work you challenge or complicate. Do not caricature
opposing positions. Summarize them accurately and then explain where your evidence leads
to a different conclusion or interpretation. This is how scholarly conversations advance.

### Updating During Revision

Keep your citations current through the review process. If a highly relevant article is
published while your manuscript is under review, incorporate it during revision. Reviewers
notice when a literature review stops two or three years before the submission date.

### Common Literature Review Problems

| Problem | Description |
|---|---|
| Author-by-author organization | Summarizing sources one at a time instead of synthesizing by theme |
| Missing the gap | Reviewing literature without arriving at a clear rationale for the current study |
| Theoretical window-dressing | Introducing theory that never appears in the analysis |
| Citation overkill | Citing ten sources where three would suffice |
| Ignoring contrary evidence | Citing only work that supports your argument |
| Outdated review | Relying on sources from a decade ago when the field has moved on |
| Disciplinary tunnel vision | Ignoring relevant work from adjacent fields |
| Paraphrase chains | Restating what each source says without connecting them to each other |

## Citations and References

### The Author-Date System

Anthropology uses the author-date (parenthetical) system, following AAA (American
Anthropological Association) style, which is closely related to Chicago author-date
format. This system places brief citations in the text and full references at the end.

### In-Text Citation Conventions

| Situation | Format |
|---|---|
| Single author | (Smith 2020) |
| Two authors | (Smith and Jones 2020) |
| Three or more authors | (Smith et al. 2020) |
| Multiple sources | (Smith 2020; Jones 2019) |
| Direct quote with page | (Smith 2020:45) |
| Author named in text | Smith (2020) argues that... |
| Supplementary reference | (see also Jones 2019) |
| Forthcoming work | (Smith, forthcoming) |
| Multiple works by same author, same year | (Smith 2020a, 2020b) |

Note the colon (not a comma) before page numbers in AAA style. Multiple sources within
a single parenthetical are separated by semicolons and ordered chronologically or
alphabetically depending on journal preference.

### Reference List Formatting

References appear at the end of the article, before any appendices. Standard formatting:

- Hanging indent (first line flush left, subsequent lines indented).
- Alphabetical by first author's last name.
- For multiple works by the same author, order reverse chronologically (most recent first)
  or chronologically, depending on the journal.
- Include all authors (do not use "et al." in the reference list).
- Article titles in sentence case. Journal titles in title case.
- Include DOIs when available.

### Common Citation Errors

| Error | How to Avoid It |
|---|---|
| Citing a source you have not read (relying on secondary citations) | Read the original or use "as cited in" format |
| Misattributing an idea to the wrong author | Verify claims against the original source |
| Inconsistent formatting (comma vs. colon before page numbers) | Follow one style guide consistently |
| Missing references (cited in text but absent from reference list) | Cross-check before submission |
| Ghost references (in reference list but never cited in text) | Cross-check before submission |
| Incorrect year or spelling of author name | Verify against the published source |

### Footnotes

Footnotes are generally rare in anthropology journals. When used, they typically serve
one of three purposes: supplementary context that would interrupt the main text,
author's notes or asides, or acknowledgments (in journals that place acknowledgments
in a footnote rather than a separate section). Avoid using footnotes for citations.

### Self-Citation

Self-citation is appropriate when you are building on your own previous work and the
reader needs that context. It becomes problematic when it is excessive or when you cite
yourself instead of the scholars who originated the ideas you are using. A reasonable
guideline: self-cite when the reference genuinely helps the reader, not to inflate your
citation count.

## Ethics Statements

### IRB and Ethics Board Approval

Most journals require a statement of ethics approval. The standard format is direct and
brief: "This research was approved by [Institution Name] Institutional Review Board
(protocol #XXX, approved [date])." Some international journals accept equivalent ethics
board approvals from non-US institutions.

If your research was exempt from IRB review (as some archival or publicly available data
research may be), state this and explain why.

### Informed Consent

Describe how informed consent was obtained. State whether consent was written, verbal,
or ongoing (as in long-term ethnographic fieldwork where consent is renegotiated over
time). If you used verbal consent rather than written consent, explain why (for example,
in contexts where signing documents carries risk or distrust).

### Confidentiality Measures

Describe the steps you took to protect participant identity:

- Use of pseudonyms for individuals and, when necessary, for organizations and locations.
- Anonymization of identifying details in quotes and descriptions.
- Data security measures: where and how data are stored, who has access, encryption.
- Any limitations on confidentiality that participants were informed about.

### Consent to Publish

Some journals require an explicit statement that participants consented not only to
participation in the research but also to publication of their anonymized data. This
is distinct from the general informed consent for research participation.

### Data Availability

Qualitative data often cannot be fully shared due to confidentiality obligations.
A standard approach is to state what can be shared (de-identified interview excerpts,
coding frameworks, analytical memos) and what cannot (full transcripts, recordings,
fieldnotes containing identifying information). Explain the reason for any restrictions.

### Reporting Checklists

Some journals, particularly in medical anthropology and qualitative health research,
require adherence to reporting checklists such as COREQ (Consolidated Criteria for
Reporting Qualitative Research) or SRQR (Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research).
Check the journal's author guidelines. Even when not required, these checklists can
improve the transparency of your methods reporting.

### Placement of Ethics Information

Journal norms vary. The most common placements are:

- A dedicated paragraph within the methods section.
- A separate "Ethical Considerations" subsection.
- The acknowledgments section (for brief statements).
- An author note or footnote (in some journals).

Check your target journal's recent issues and author guidelines to determine the expected
format and location.

## Visuals and Multimodal Elements

### When to Include Visuals

Include figures, photographs, maps, or tables when they communicate information more
effectively than text alone. A map of your field site orients the reader spatially. A
photograph of a ritual object conveys detail that description cannot. A table summarizes
demographic data or coding categories at a glance.

Do not include visuals for decoration. Every figure or table should be referenced in the
text and should contribute to the argument.

### Caption Writing

Write informative captions that explain what the reader is seeing and why it matters.
A caption should be self-contained: a reader glancing at the figure and its caption
should understand the basic point without reading the surrounding text.

Bad caption: "Figure 1. The market."
Good caption: "Figure 1. The central market in [Location], where most daily social
and economic exchanges take place. Photograph by author, July 2022."

### In-Text References

Reference every figure and table in the text. Use either the narrative form ("Figure 1
shows the spatial layout of the clinic") or the parenthetical form ("Participants
gathered daily in the central courtyard (see Figure 2)"). Be consistent in format
throughout the manuscript.

### Tables

Tables are useful for structured data: demographic summaries of participants, comparison
matrices, coding frameworks, timelines, or typologies. Keep tables clean and readable.
Avoid cramming too much information into a single table. Every table needs a title and
should be referenced in the text.

### Photographs

Photographs raise specific ethical considerations:

- **Consent**: Obtain explicit consent for any identifiable images. Some participants
  may consent to research but not to having their photograph published.
- **Anonymization**: Consider whether faces need to be obscured or whether the photograph
  can be framed to avoid identification.
- **Caption conventions**: Include location, date, photographer credit, and any relevant
  context.
- **Resolution**: Most journals require high-resolution images (300 DPI minimum for
  print).

### Maps

Maps are valuable for showing field sites, research areas, migration routes, or spatial
relationships relevant to the analysis. Include a scale bar, north arrow, and clear
labels. If using base maps from external sources, credit them appropriately.

### Visual Anthropology Considerations

Journals specializing in visual anthropology have more extensive requirements for
integrating images into the argument. In these venues, photographs and visual materials
are not supplementary; they are central to the analysis. Expect requirements around
image sequencing, the relationship between visual and textual argument, and higher
standards for image quality and integration.

### Submission Formatting

Most journals want figures and tables placed after the references in the submitted
manuscript, each on its own page, numbered sequentially. Insert a callout in the text
(e.g., "[Insert Figure 1 here]") to indicate placement. The production team handles
final placement during typesetting. Check author guidelines, as some journals now accept
or prefer embedded figures.

---

## Title and Keyword Optimization

### Crafting a Title

The title is the first thing readers, reviewers, and search algorithms encounter. Keep
it concise, ideally under fifteen words, with key terms placed early for discoverability.
The reader should know what the article is about from the title alone.

Avoid obscure or overly clever titles that sacrifice clarity for style. A play on words
may be memorable, but if it does not communicate the article's content, it fails its
primary function.

### Subtitle Conventions

The "Main Title: Subtitle" format is common in anthropology. The main title often
captures the ethnographic specificity or theoretical framing, while the subtitle provides
the descriptive grounding. For example: "Waiting as Labor: Temporal Politics in a
Ugandan Refugee Settlement."

### Keywords

Select three to seven keywords that capture the main themes, methods, geographic focus,
and theoretical orientation of your article. Keywords should overlap with terms used in
the title and abstract but also include synonyms or related terms that a researcher
might use when searching.

Balancing specificity and searchability matters: "medical pluralism" is more precise than
"health" but still findable. Include at least one geographic or population term and one
methodological or theoretical term.

## Common Writing Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Description | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Burying the argument | The main claim does not appear until page five or later | State the argument in the introduction; preview it in the abstract |
| Passive voice overuse | The writing feels flat and agentless throughout | Identify who acts and rewrite in active voice; reserve passive for deliberate purposes |
| Jargon without definition | Technical terms are deployed as if the reader shares your theoretical vocabulary | Define every technical term on first use; consider whether the term is necessary |
| Over-hedging | Every claim is qualified with "perhaps," "might," "seems to" | Reserve hedging for genuinely uncertain claims; state well-supported interpretations with confidence |
| Description without analysis | Pages of ethnographic detail with no interpretive commentary | Follow every descriptive passage with explicit analytical commentary |
| All theory, no evidence | Theoretical discussion dominates with little ethnographic grounding | Anchor every theoretical claim in specific evidence from your data |
| Chronological when thematic would be better | The article follows a timeline when the argument would be clearer organized by theme | Reorganize around analytical themes; use chronology only when sequence matters to the argument |
| Repetition across sections | The introduction, methods, and discussion all say the same thing in slightly different words | Give each section a distinct job; avoid restating what the reader already knows |
| Overly long paragraphs | Paragraphs run to a full page or more, losing the reader | Break paragraphs at logical shifts; aim for one main idea per paragraph |
| Missing transitions | Sections and paragraphs feel disconnected from each other | Add transitional sentences that link the previous point to the next |
| Literature dump without synthesis | The literature review lists sources without connecting them to each other or to the study | Organize by debate or theme; synthesize rather than summarize |
| Conclusion introduces new material | New evidence, arguments, or citations appear in the conclusion for the first time | Move new material to the appropriate section; the conclusion synthesizes and extends, not introduces |
