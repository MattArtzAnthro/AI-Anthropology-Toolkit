# Subfield-Specific Writing Conventions in Anthropology

This reference guide covers the distinct writing conventions, structural expectations, and publication norms across the major subfields of anthropology. Use it to calibrate your writing for a specific audience, adapt work that crosses subfield boundaries, and understand what reviewers in each tradition expect.

## Cultural and Social Anthropology

### Vignette-Led Article Structure

The dominant article form in cultural and social anthropology opens with an ethnographic vignette: a scene from fieldwork that crystallizes the central problem. This is not mere decoration. The opening vignette establishes the empirical stakes, introduces the field site and interlocutors, and implicitly signals the theoretical intervention. A strong vignette does not need to be dramatic; it needs to be analytically generative, raising a question that the rest of the article will elaborate and reframe.

After the vignette, a typical structure moves through: framing the problem and situating the contribution within existing literature; describing methods and field context (sometimes folded into the introduction); two to four thematic ethnographic sections, each organized around a scene, case, or analytic thread; and a conclusion that returns to the opening scene with deepened understanding.

### Thick Description as Analytical Method

Thick description, following Clifford Geertz, is not simply detailed or rich writing. It is an analytical practice in which the ethnographer layers contextual meaning onto observed action, showing how a gesture, utterance, or event is embedded in webs of significance. In writing, this means that descriptive passages should simultaneously advance an interpretive argument. Every detail selected for inclusion should do conceptual work.

A common mistake is to treat thick description as "more adjectives" or "longer passages." Instead, thickness refers to the density of interpretive layering. A thin description reports what happened; a thick description shows what the action means to the actors involved, how it connects to broader social structures, and why it matters for the analytical argument being developed. The writer must select details that carry multiple levels of meaning and present them in ways that allow the reader to see those levels simultaneously.

### Theory-Data Integration

Cultural anthropology does not follow the IMRaD convention of separating results from interpretation. Instead, each empirical section should be doing theoretical work. A section on market transactions is also a section on value theory. A section on a healing ritual is also a section on ontology or care. The writer's task is to make ethnographic specificity and conceptual abstraction illuminate each other on the same page, often in the same paragraph.

### Participant Voice

Direct quotes from interlocutors are primary evidence. Extended interview excerpts and fieldnote passages give readers access to how people articulate their own experience. Quotes should be introduced with context (who is speaking, under what circumstances) and followed by analytical commentary. Avoid letting quotes stand alone without interpretation, and avoid reducing participants to mouthpieces for the author's argument.

### First-Person Reflexivity

The researcher's subject position matters. Cultural anthropology expects some degree of reflexive acknowledgment: how your presence shaped interactions, what your social location enabled and foreclosed, how your understanding shifted over time. This should be purposeful rather than confessional. Reflexivity is strongest when it reveals something about the ethnographic situation, not just about the ethnographer.

### Narrative Craft

Good ethnographic writing involves scene-setting, character development, and temporal arc. Interlocutors should emerge as complex people, not anonymous informants. Transitions between sections should feel like movement through a world, not a list of topics. The best ethnographic articles read as stories that happen to be making theoretical arguments.

Concrete techniques include: opening scenes with sensory detail that anchors the reader in a specific place and time; introducing interlocutors through action rather than biography; using dialogue to convey relationships and tensions; and building temporal progression so the reader experiences a sense of unfolding discovery. Avoid the trap of organizing sections by theme alone with no narrative thread connecting them. Even analytically organized articles benefit from moments of scene and voice that keep the reader grounded in the ethnographic world.

### Literature Integration

Literature review is typically woven into the introduction and framing sections rather than presented as a standalone section. The discussion or conclusion may return to the literature to clarify the contribution. Avoid front-loading a long literature review before the reader has encountered your ethnographic material.

The most effective approach is to introduce theoretical and empirical literature as it becomes relevant to the argument, citing key works in the introduction to position the contribution and then engaging more specific literature within ethnographic sections as needed. This avoids the deadening effect of a long "literature review" section that reads as a catalogue of prior work disconnected from the ethnographic material that follows. The goal is conversation with the literature, not inventory.

### Key Journals and Word Counts

Major journals include American Ethnologist, American Anthropologist, Cultural Anthropology, JRAI (Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute), Social Analysis, Ethnos, and Critique of Anthropology. Word counts typically run 8,000 to 11,000 including references, though Cultural Anthropology and some European journals allow longer pieces.

## Linguistic Anthropology

### Discourse Data as Primary Evidence

Linguistic anthropology articles are built around speech transcripts, conversation excerpts, and textual artifacts. The core evidence is language-in-use: what people actually said, how they said it, and what that reveals about social processes. Data presentation must be precise enough for other scholars to evaluate the analysis, which means following established transcription conventions.

### Interlinear Glosses

When presenting data from languages other than English, or when morphological structure is analytically relevant, linguistic anthropologists use interlinear glosses. These typically follow a three-line or four-line format: the original utterance, a morpheme-by-morpheme gloss, grammatical category abbreviations, and a free translation. The Leipzig Glossing Rules provide the standard conventions. Even when full interlinear glosses are not required, foreign-language data should be presented with consistent formatting and translation.

### Ethnopoetic Formatting

When analyzing oral performance, verbal art, or narrative, linguistic anthropologists may use ethnopoetic line formatting to represent the structure of speech as delivered. This means breaking prose into lines and verses that reflect pauses, prosodic contours, parallelism, and narrative structure rather than sentence grammar. This formatting is itself an analytical claim about how the speech is organized.

### Common Theoretical Frames

Indexicality (how linguistic forms point to social contexts and identities), language ideology (beliefs and assumptions about language that shape its use and evaluation), and semiotic processes more broadly are the backbone of most linguistic anthropology articles. Other common frames include performativity, register, code-switching, and narrative analysis.

### Balancing Technical and Social Analysis

The challenge in linguistic anthropology writing is holding together two audiences: readers who need to see the linguistic detail to evaluate the analysis, and readers who care about the social and cultural argument. The most effective articles present linguistic data clearly and then draw out its social implications without requiring specialized linguistic training to follow the main argument.

One practical strategy is to present the linguistic data in a transcript excerpt, immediately follow it with a close analysis of specific features, and then step back to articulate the broader social or cultural point. This three-step rhythm (show, analyze, interpret) allows both specialist and generalist readers to follow the argument at their own level of engagement with the linguistic detail.

### Presenting Audio and Video Data in Text

Because linguistic anthropology often works with audio and video recordings, writers must develop conventions for representing multimodal data on the page. This includes transcription notation for overlapping speech, pauses, intonation, laughter, and gesture. Jefferson notation is common for conversation analysis-influenced work. Descriptions of embodied action may be integrated into transcript lines or presented in a separate column.

When presenting transcript data, provide a key to transcription conventions either in a footnote, an appendix, or at the first appearance of transcript data. Readers should never have to guess what a symbol means. Common conventions include square brackets for overlapping speech, numbers in parentheses for timed pauses, colons for vowel lengthening, and arrows for rising or falling intonation. If your transcription system is idiosyncratic or combines elements from multiple traditions, explain this explicitly.

### Key Journals and Structure

Major journals include the Journal of Linguistic Anthropology, Language in Society, Language & Communication, and Pragmatics. Article structure is similar to cultural anthropology (problem framing, ethnographic/analytic sections, discussion) but with the addition of transcript data conventions, a section on transcription and recording methods, and sometimes an appendix of transcription symbols.

## Medical Anthropology

### Clinical and Illness Narratives as Evidence

Medical anthropology articles frequently build their arguments around narratives of illness, healing, and clinical encounter. These narratives function as both evidence and analytical vehicle, showing how structural forces manifest in individual experience. A patient's story of navigating a fragmented health system is simultaneously data about that system's organization and a window into subjective suffering.

### Bridging Social Science and Health Science Audiences

Medical anthropology occupies a distinctive position between the interpretive social sciences and the health sciences. Writing must be legible to clinicians, public health researchers, and policy makers as well as to anthropologists. This means defining anthropological concepts clearly, avoiding insider jargon without sacrificing analytical precision, and demonstrating practical relevance without reducing the work to applied problem-solving.

### Common Theoretical Frames

Structural violence (how social arrangements produce suffering), biopower and biopolitics (how life itself becomes an object of governance), and the anthropology of care (how care is practiced, distributed, and withheld) are among the most common frames. Other important theoretical resources include the social determinants of health, therapeutic landscapes, pharmaceutical subjectivities, and the politics of evidence.

### Case Vignettes as Opening Strategy

Like cultural anthropology, medical anthropology articles often open with a case vignette, but the vignettes tend to center on clinical encounters, healing episodes, or moments of crisis in a patient or healer's trajectory. The opening case should be compelling, ethically presented, and analytically productive. Composite cases (combining details from multiple individuals) are sometimes used to protect identities, but this should be disclosed. When presenting clinical narratives, attend to the power dynamics of who tells the story and whose perspective is centered. Patient voices should be presented with dignity and context, not reduced to symptoms or suffering.

### Balancing Ethnographic Depth with Policy Relevance

The strongest medical anthropology articles manage to be both deeply ethnographic and clearly relevant to health policy or clinical practice. This does not mean tacking on a policy recommendation at the end. It means structuring the argument so that ethnographic insights challenge, complicate, or reframe assumptions that operate in health policy and clinical settings.

### Ethics Considerations

Clinical settings and vulnerable populations impose heightened ethical demands. Writing about patients, clinical encounters, and health data requires careful attention to anonymization, informed consent, and the potential consequences of publication for the people described. Ethical reflections may be addressed explicitly in a methods section or woven into the narrative.

Medical anthropology raises ethical questions that other subfields encounter less frequently. Research in clinical settings involves navigating IRB (Institutional Review Board) requirements that may be oriented toward biomedical rather than ethnographic research. Writing about seriously ill people, people with stigmatized conditions, or people in extreme poverty requires weighing the analytical value of specific details against the risk of identification or harm. When working at the intersection of anthropology and clinical practice, authors must also consider how their published findings might affect clinical relationships or community trust in health institutions.

### Key Journals and Word Counts

Major journals include Medical Anthropology Quarterly, Social Science & Medicine, Culture Medicine and Psychiatry, and Medical Anthropology. Word counts range from 6,000 to 10,000 depending on the journal; Social Science & Medicine tends toward the shorter end with tighter structure, while Medical Anthropology Quarterly allows more ethnographic development.

## Biological and Physical Anthropology

### Hypothesis-Driven Structure

Biological anthropology follows the natural science convention of organizing articles around clearly stated hypotheses. The introduction identifies a gap in knowledge, reviews relevant findings, and states specific hypotheses or predictions to be tested. This is a fundamentally different orientation from interpretive anthropology: the goal is to produce testable, falsifiable claims about human biological variation, evolution, or adaptation.

### Third-Person Objective Voice

The default voice is third-person and impersonal. Sentences like "We hypothesized that..." or "The sample was analyzed using..." are standard. First-person reflection on the researcher's subject position is rare and generally unwelcome. The register is formal and scientific.

### Quantitative Data Presentation

Tables, charts, and graphs are central to biological anthropology articles. Statistical methods must be named and justified. Results sections present data systematically, often organized by hypothesis or variable. Common visualizations include scatter plots, box plots, phylogenetic trees, and morphometric shape analyses (such as principal component plots). All figures must be clearly labeled, with legends explaining symbols and abbreviations.

### Results Before Discussion

The IMRaD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) is followed much more strictly than in sociocultural subfields. Results are presented before they are interpreted. The discussion section is where findings are placed in the context of prior work and theoretical significance is drawn out.

### Methods: Detailed and Reproducible

Methods sections must be detailed enough for another researcher to replicate the study. This includes: sample descriptions (species, population, age, sex, sample size), measurement protocols, imaging techniques, laboratory procedures, statistical tests and software used, and any corrections applied (such as Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons). Data availability statements are increasingly required, specifying where raw data can be accessed or why access is restricted.

### Figures and Visual Data

Figures are not illustrations in biological anthropology; they are primary evidence. Phylogenetic trees must include branch support values and scale bars. Scatter plots and principal component analyses should show confidence ellipses where appropriate. Morphometric analyses often require both landmark configurations and shape deformation grids. Tables should report descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, sample sizes) as well as test statistics and p-values. Supplementary materials may include full datasets, additional statistical tests, and high-resolution images.

### Key Journals and Word Counts

Major journals include the American Journal of Biological Anthropology (formerly the American Journal of Physical Anthropology), Journal of Human Evolution, Primates, and Evolutionary Anthropology. Word counts typically range from 5,000 to 8,000 for the main text, with supplementary data files often containing additional tables, figures, and methodological details. Evolutionary Anthropology is distinctive in publishing review and synthesis articles aimed at a broader audience, with an emphasis on accessible prose.

## Archaeology

### Material Evidence as Primary Data

Archaeological writing is organized around material evidence: artifacts, features, sites, landscapes, and the spatial and temporal relationships among them. Descriptions of material culture must be precise, using established typological and analytical terminology. The evidentiary base is things, not words or behaviors observed in real time, and the writing must convey both the physical characteristics of the evidence and its interpretive significance.

### Detailed Methods

Archaeological methods sections describe excavation protocols (unit sizes, excavation strategy, recording systems), survey methods, dating techniques (radiocarbon, luminescence, seriation, stratigraphy), and material analysis techniques (petrography, residue analysis, faunal identification, lithic analysis). As in biological anthropology, the standard is reproducibility.

### Visual Documentation

Archaeology is an intensely visual discipline. Articles routinely include site maps, plan and profile drawings, stratigraphic diagrams, artifact photographs and illustrations, distribution maps, and quantitative charts. Figures are not supplementary; they carry essential information that text alone cannot convey. Figure quality matters, and journals have specific requirements for resolution, scale bars, and labeling.

### Contextual Interpretation Grounded in Material Evidence

Archaeological interpretation must be anchored in the material record. Claims about past behavior, social organization, or belief systems must be connected to specific evidence and to the inferential chain that links material patterns to human action. Speculation is acceptable when clearly identified as such, but the norm is evidentiary caution. Writers must make the inferential logic explicit: what assumptions connect this artifact pattern to that behavioral interpretation? What alternative explanations have been considered and why were they rejected? The strength of archaeological writing lies in the transparency of its reasoning from material evidence to social interpretation.

### Theory in Discussion

In many archaeological articles, especially those focused on site reports or material analyses, theoretical framing is concentrated in the introduction and discussion sections rather than integrated throughout the findings. The findings sections tend to be descriptive and empirical, presenting the evidence before the interpretive discussion begins. More theoretically oriented articles (common in journals like the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory) integrate theory more thoroughly.

### Varying Scales

Archaeological articles operate at different scales: a site report presents detailed findings from a single excavation; a regional synthesis draws on multiple sites to reconstruct larger patterns; a theoretical contribution may use archaeological cases to intervene in broader debates. Each scale has its own conventions for evidence presentation and argument structure. Site reports emphasize thoroughness and detail, providing the primary record that other scholars will draw on. Regional syntheses require broader framing and careful attention to how evidence from different sites is made comparable. Theoretical articles must demonstrate deep familiarity with the material record while using it to advance a conceptual argument that speaks beyond the specific case.

### Key Journals and Word Counts

Major journals include American Antiquity, Journal of Archaeological Science, Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory, Cambridge Archaeological Journal, and Latin American Antiquity. Word counts typically range from 6,000 to 9,000, though articles heavy with figures may have shorter text sections. Some journals have separate formats for site reports and for analytical or theoretical articles.

---

## Applied Anthropology

### Problem-Oriented Structure

Applied anthropology articles are organized around a problem: a community health challenge, a development intervention, an organizational dysfunction, a policy failure. The introduction frames the problem in practical terms and establishes why anthropological methods and perspectives are needed to address it. The question driving the article is not only "What is happening here?" but also "What should be done about it?"

### Actionable Findings

Applied articles are expected to produce findings that can inform action. This may take the form of explicit recommendations, design principles, policy implications, or lessons learned. A "Recommendations" or "Implications for Practice" section is common and expected. Findings should be presented in terms that practitioners and stakeholders can use.

### Multiple Audiences

Applied anthropology writing must be legible to academic anthropologists, practitioners in the relevant field (health, education, development, business), and sometimes community members and policy makers. This means writing accessibly without condescending, defining terms without over-explaining, and demonstrating both analytical sophistication and practical relevance.

### Collaborative and Community-Engaged Framing

Much applied work is conducted in collaboration with communities, organizations, or institutions. The writing should reflect this: describing collaborative processes, acknowledging community partners, and presenting findings in ways that respect the agency and knowledge of the people involved. Participatory and community-based research methods should be described in full.

Community-engaged framing also raises questions about authorship and voice. Some applied anthropologists include community partners as co-authors. Others use acknowledgments sections to recognize contributions that do not meet formal authorship criteria. In either case, the writing should make clear how the research relationship was structured, who had input into the research design and interpretation, and how findings were shared with the community before or alongside academic publication.

### Balancing Rigor with Accessibility

The tension in applied writing is between the analytical rigor expected by academic reviewers and the clarity expected by practitioner audiences. The strongest applied articles achieve both, using ethnographic and analytical methods to produce insights that are both intellectually substantive and practically useful.

### Key Journals

Major journals include Human Organization, Practicing Anthropology, and the Journal of Applied Social Science. Human Organization publishes full-length research articles with conventional academic structure. Practicing Anthropology publishes shorter, more practitioner-oriented pieces. Some applied work also appears in interdisciplinary journals specific to the domain of application (global health, education, organizational studies).

### Practical Recommendations Section

Unlike most other subfields, applied anthropology articles often include an explicit section on recommendations, implications for practice, or next steps. This section should be concrete and actionable, specifying who should do what and under what conditions. Avoid vague gestures toward "more research is needed." Instead, identify specific changes in practice, policy, or program design that your findings support. Where possible, distinguish between recommendations that are well-supported by your data and those that are more speculative, and acknowledge the limitations of your evidence base for informing action.

## Adapting Between Subfields

### When Your Work Crosses Boundaries

Much contemporary anthropology sits at the intersection of subfields. Bioarchaeology combines biological anthropology and archaeology. Medical anthropology with biological data bridges interpretive and quantitative traditions. Linguistic anthropology of health communication touches medical and linguistic subfields simultaneously. When your work crosses boundaries, you must make deliberate choices about which conventions to prioritize.

### Choosing Your Primary Audience

The first decision is: who is the primary audience for this piece? If you are a bioarchaeologist submitting to a biological anthropology journal, foreground hypothesis-driven structure, quantitative methods, and IMRaD formatting, even if your interpretation draws on social theory. If the same work is headed to an archaeology journal, you can integrate interpretation more fluidly and give more space to contextual description of the site and its material record.

This is not about dumbing down or leaving things out. It is about foregrounding the elements that your primary audience needs to evaluate the work and locating other elements where that audience expects to find them.

### Interdisciplinary Journals and Their Expectations

Some journals are explicitly interdisciplinary. American Anthropologist accepts work from all four fields and expects authors to make their work accessible across subfield boundaries. Social Science & Medicine bridges anthropology, sociology, public health, and epidemiology. Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory welcomes theoretically ambitious work that may draw on social theory from outside archaeology.

When submitting to interdisciplinary journals, define your terms, explain your methods clearly, and do not assume shared theoretical vocabulary. The introduction should do more work to orient a diverse readership, and the discussion should explicitly draw out implications for audiences beyond your home subfield.

### Framing Your Theoretical Contribution for a Different Audience

If you are a cultural anthropologist presenting work to an archaeological audience, explain why your theoretical framework matters for understanding material evidence. If you are a biological anthropologist writing for a medical anthropology journal, show how your quantitative findings speak to questions about health inequity or structural violence. The key is translation: not abandoning your analytical framework, but articulating its relevance in terms that resonate with the conventions and concerns of the target audience.

Practical strategies for cross-subfield translation include: opening with an empirical puzzle that both audiences recognize; using the introduction to map your contribution onto debates in the target subfield; providing a brief but clear explanation of methods unfamiliar to the target audience; and using the discussion to explicitly connect your findings to the target audience's theoretical landscape.

### Common Cross-Subfield Combinations

**Bioarchaeology** draws on both biological anthropology and archaeology. When writing for biological anthropology journals, foreground hypotheses, quantitative methods, and skeletal data. When writing for archaeology journals, emphasize site context, cultural interpretation, and how biological evidence illuminates social questions. Both audiences expect detailed methods, but the framing and emphasis differ substantially.

**Forensic Anthropology** bridges biological anthropology, legal studies, and applied practice. Writing must be precise enough to hold up under legal scrutiny while also making contributions to the biological anthropology literature. Case reports follow a distinct format with chain-of-custody documentation and standardized assessment protocols.

**Environmental and Ecological Anthropology** may combine ethnographic methods with ecological data, spatial analysis, or climate science. These articles must navigate between interpretive and positivist expectations, often requiring both qualitative narrative and quantitative environmental data in the same piece.

**Digital and Visual Anthropology** increasingly crosses all subfields, introducing questions about media, technology, and representation that require their own methodological and ethical frameworks. Writing for these emerging areas often involves explaining novel methods to audiences unfamiliar with digital tools or visual research practices.

### Tone and Register Adjustments

Beyond structure, crossing subfields requires adjusting tone and register. Moving from cultural anthropology to biological anthropology means shifting from first-person reflexive prose to third-person objective reporting. Moving from biological anthropology to medical anthropology means adding narrative and interpretive registers to quantitative precision. Moving from any academic subfield to applied outlets means reducing jargon, shortening sentences, and foregrounding practical implications over theoretical nuance.

The key principle is: match the register your audience expects, but do not lose the analytical substance that makes your work a contribution. A biological anthropologist writing for a cultural anthropology journal can use first person and narrative framing without abandoning methodological precision. A cultural anthropologist writing for a health science journal can adopt structured abstracts and clear methods sections without flattening the ethnographic complexity of the analysis.

## Writing Pitfalls by Subfield

Each subfield has characteristic weaknesses that reviewers flag repeatedly. Being aware of these patterns can help you anticipate and avoid them.

**Cultural/Social Anthropology**: Over-theorizing without sufficient ethnographic grounding; using jargon as a substitute for clear analysis; reflexivity that centers the researcher at the expense of the interlocutors; ethnographic sections that describe without analyzing; conclusions that merely summarize rather than synthesize.

**Linguistic Anthropology**: Presenting transcript data without sufficient social or cultural context; assuming readers share specialized linguistic vocabulary; failing to connect discourse-level analysis to broader anthropological questions; under-explaining transcription conventions.

**Medical Anthropology**: Reducing complex social situations to policy recommendations; privileging clinical perspectives over patient or community perspectives; using suffering as rhetorical decoration rather than as analytically productive evidence; under-engaging with medical anthropology theory while over-citing public health literature.

**Biological/Physical Anthropology**: Inadequate sample sizes without appropriate statistical acknowledgment; over-interpreting results beyond what the data support; methods sections that omit critical details needed for replication; discussion sections that fail to situate findings within evolutionary or comparative frameworks.

**Archaeology**: Descriptive reports that lack interpretive ambition; theoretical claims unsupported by the material evidence presented; inadequate attention to formation processes and taphonomy; figures that are poorly reproduced or lack essential information like scale bars and north arrows.

**Applied Anthropology**: Recommendations disconnected from the ethnographic evidence; failing to acknowledge the limitations of anthropological expertise for informing practice; writing that is too academic for practitioner audiences or too informal for academic ones; insufficient attention to the ethics of representing community partners.

## A Note on Evolving Conventions

Subfield conventions are not static. Open-access publishing, digital media, multimodal scholarship, and growing attention to decolonizing research practices are reshaping expectations across all subfields. Some journals now accept or encourage multimedia supplements, creative formats, or collaborative authorship with community partners. Others are experimenting with open peer review or post-publication commentary.

Writers should stay current with the specific journals they target, reading recent issues to understand what is being published now rather than relying solely on older models. The conventions described in this guide represent the mainstream as of the mid-2020s, but the landscape continues to shift.

Particular areas of change include: growing expectations for data sharing and transparency across all subfields; increasing acceptance of collaborative and community-authored work; experimentation with short-form and digital-first publication formats; and ongoing debates about open access, paywalls, and the politics of academic publishing. Awareness of these shifts is part of writing competence in contemporary anthropology.

Additionally, attention to positionality statements, land acknowledgments, and ethical engagement with Indigenous communities and knowledge systems is becoming standard across subfields, though the specific expectations vary by journal and national academic tradition. Writers should consult both journal guidelines and disciplinary discussions about ethical research practices when preparing manuscripts that engage with historically marginalized communities.
