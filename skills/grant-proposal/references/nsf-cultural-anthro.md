## Critical Framing: What NSF Will and Will Not Fund

This is the single most important section for anthropology applicants.
NSF's mission is to support **basic scientific research.** The following
will be **returned without review:**

- Research taking as its primary goal improved clinical practice, humanistic
  understanding, or applied policy
- Research that applies anthropological methods to a social problem but does
  not propose a theory-testing or theory-expanding contribution to anthropology
- Arguments not subject to falsification via empirical discovery and data
  analysis
- Projects motivated strictly by philosophical or humanistic questions
- Projects that source information in service of a particular theoretical
  position without putting that position at risk of falsification
- Projects focused narrowly on describing a particular ethnographic site
  without framing in terms of larger, generalizable questions
- Non-generalizable data collection centered on describing a site

**This means:** Even for qualitative/ethnographic research, the proposal must
frame questions with falsifiable or empirically adjudicable stakes. The
research must contribute to anthropological theory beyond the specific site
and context. "Interesting ethnographic description" is not sufficient.

### Program Research Priorities (not exhaustive)

- Sociocultural drivers of critical anthropogenic processes (deforestation,
  desertification, land cover change, urbanization, poverty)
- Resilience and robustness of sociocultural systems
- Scientific principles underlying conflict, cooperation, altruism;
  variation in culture, norms, behaviors, institutions
- Economy, culture, migration, globalization
- Variability and change in kinship and family norms and practices
- Cultural and social principles underlying health outcomes and disease
  transmission drivers
- Biocultural work (nexus of culture and biology)
- Social regulation, governmentality, violence
- Origins of complexity in sociocultural systems
- Language and culture: orality/literacy, sociolinguistics, cognition
- Theoretically informed co-production approaches to human variability and
  environmental stewardship
- Mathematical and computational models of sociocultural systems (social
  network analysis, agent-based models, multi-level models, GIS integration)
- Sociocultural drivers of technology and technological systems (AI, machine
  learning, augmented data, platforms)

## Proposal Structure

### Proposal Setup

- Title must begin with **"Doctoral Dissertation Research:"**
- Title should be descriptive, emphasizing the generalizable science and
  main research question (not clever or catchy)
- Select "Research" as proposal type; single proposal format
- Separately submitted collaborative proposals will be returned without review

### Senior/Key Personnel

- List primary dissertation advisor as "PI"
- List student as "co-PI"

### Project Description (10 single-spaced pages of text)

This is the core document. "Results from Prior NSF Support" is NOT required
for DDRIGs. The project description must include ALL of the following:

#### 1. Research Problem and Scientific Importance

Statement of the research problem, specific aims, questions or hypotheses.
Research questions must be **empirically driven** and **subject to
falsification** through data collection and analysis.

#### 2. Intellectual Merit Section

**Clearly label this section** (recommended labels: "Intellectual Merit,"
"Scientific Generalizability," or "Scientific Merit" — NOT "Literature
Review").

Must describe:
- The project's potential contribution to advancing anthropological theory
  **beyond the site and context** of the project itself
- A focused review of what is currently known about the topic
- A clear statement of the project's original contribution and why it is
  significant
- Proposals that list areas of scholarship without showing how theory will
  be tested, queried, or advanced are **not sufficient**

#### 3. Broader Impacts Section

**Must be labeled "Broader Impacts."** Discuss significant effects beyond
basic science and the pathways by which they will be realized. Examples:

- Communicating results to policy makers
- Contributing to knowledge for solving social problems
- Engaging students in research
- Public outreach
- Producing databases for scientific infrastructure
- Strengthening international collaborations
- Broadening participation of underrepresented communities
- Strengthening research capacity in developing nations

**Partisan activities related to advocacy/activism fall outside NSF's
statutory mission and should not be included.**

#### 4. Preliminary Studies

Discussion of any preliminary studies performed by the student, results,
and how they inform the project.

#### 5. Technical Training and Preparation

Account of whether the student has relevant technical training, language
competence, and other preparation. Must include explanation of how the
student obtained methodological training (at their institution or elsewhere).

#### 6. Positionality Statement

Statement of steps taken to ensure objectivity given student positionality
with respect to research site(s), question(s), and hypotheses.

#### 7. Research Design

Must include:
- Discussion of research site(s) and data sources
- Methods by which data will be collected to answer questions or test
  hypotheses
- Reasons those methods are the most appropriate

#### 8. Sample Design

Clear description of the systematic strategy for recruiting research
participants and a justified estimate of sample size necessary to achieve
research objectives. Must explain how strategies mitigate sampling bias,
omitted variables, and confirmation biases.

#### 9. Data Analysis Plan (~1 page)

A well-developed data analysis plan explaining how data will be
**systematically analyzed** to address the specific research questions,
aims, or hypotheses.

This is usually about one page. Specify: coding approach, analytical
framework, triangulation strategy, what constitutes evidence for or against
the hypotheses/questions.

#### 10. Timeline

Research schedule including the date funds are required.

### Data Management and Sharing Plan (required, separate document)

Must address:
- What kinds of data, software, and other materials will the research produce?
- How will they be managed (metadata standards, format, organization)?
- How will other researchers access data while preserving confidentiality,
  security, IP, and other rights?
- How will data be archived and preserved in publicly accessible,
  institutionally maintained repositories? (A departmental website is not
  adequate.)

Applicants are encouraged to consult the AAA Statement on Professional
Ethics. Those planning to use a standard archive (QDR at Syracuse, ICPSR
at Michigan, Harvard Dataverse) should contact the archive before starting
research to ascertain requirements for permissions or metadata.

### Budget and Budget Justification

Budget justification pages should detail and explain the rationale for each
item. Key formatting rules:

- Travel expenses (food, lodging, transportation away from normal residence):
  budget under **"Travel – Domestic"** or **"Travel – Foreign"**
- All other expenses: budget under **"Other Direct Costs"**
- **No items under "Consultants" or "Sub-awards"** — local field assistants
  go under "Other Direct Costs"
- Participant incentive payments: under **"Other Direct Costs"** — do NOT
  describe as "gifts"
- Software: use academic pricing where available
- PI and co-PI names must be **removed** from Senior/Key Personnel listing
  on budget pages (no salary allowed, and listing would imply voluntary
  cost sharing which is prohibited)

#### Allowable expenses:

- Travel and related expenses to research sites, archives, collections,
  facilities away from campus
- Data collection costs
- Modest field equipment (laptops, photo/video/audio equipment), materials,
  supplies — appropriate to scientific need, current market prices; top-of-
  the-line generally not funded without specific justification
- Participant incentives as needed for participation (pre-paid gift cards,
  payments for long surveys, multiple sessions, medical testing)
  - ALLOWABLE: books needed to perform a study at a school; incentives for
    participation that likely could not be completed without them
  - NOT ALLOWABLE: donation of books to a needy school; gifts simply because
    it is cultural custom
- Casual/itinerant research assistance (e.g., local field assistants) —
  must justify significance to project execution
- Other essential research services not otherwise available
- Travel-specific insurance (medical evacuation, repatriation of remains)
- Modest living expenses during research away from university (typically
  less than State Dept/GAO per diem rates)
- Per diem for local research (within 50 miles) if conducted full time —
  under "Other Direct Costs"
- Visa costs
- Broader impacts-related costs
- Dependent/childcare travel costs per 2 CFR § 200.475 (consult program
  officers in advance)

#### NOT allowable:

- Salary or stipends for student or advisor
- Tuition, university fees, textbooks, journals
- Dissertation preparation costs
- Routine medical insurance, mortgage, personal clothing, toiletries,
  over-the-counter medicines, other non-research items
- **Transcription services** (not ordinarily allowed)
- Consultants (Line G3) or sub-awards (Line G5)
- Expensive cameras/computers without scientific justification
- Equipment insurance
- Post-field writing, analysis, thesis production costs

### Supplementary Documentation

- Up to **2 pages** of technical illustrations, maps, or sample survey
  questions
- If project depends on access to a non-public site (clinic, Indigenous
  territory, business), obtain an access letter using NSF's template
  (acknowledgment of access, not endorsement)
- **No letters of reference** or evaluation
- **No departmental progress assessment letter**

### Facilities, Equipment & Other Resources

If resources from other awards will supplement the NSF award, list them
here (not in budget justification).

### Cover Sheet

Mark human subjects as pending, approved, or exempted.

## Co-Review with Other NSF Programs

A student may request co-review with other programs if the work makes a
strong case for advancing theory and basic knowledge in multiple communities.
The contribution must be **theoretical and scientific** — methods relevant
to other programs are not sufficient. Not all programs support DDRIG
co-review; verify in advance.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

NSF uses two standard merit review criteria:

1. **Intellectual Merit:** The potential to advance knowledge
2. **Broader Impacts:** The potential to benefit society and contribute to
   desired societal outcomes

For CA-DDRIGs specifically, reviewers attend to: scientific importance of
research questions, theoretical contribution beyond site/context,
methodological sophistication, feasibility, preparation, sample design
rigor, and the quality of the data analysis plan.

## Common Failure Modes Specific to NSF

| Failure mode | What happens | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| Primarily applied/policy-oriented | Returned without review | Frame every applied concern as a test of or contribution to theory |
| Purely humanistic/philosophical | Returned without review | Ensure questions are empirically driven and falsifiable |
| Narrow ethnographic description | Returned without review | Show how the site/case illuminates generalizable questions |
| "Literature review" that lists areas | Insufficient for intellectual merit | Show how theory is tested, queried, or advanced |
| No labeled broader impacts section | Does not meet requirements | Include a clearly labeled section with specific pathways |
| Vague analysis plan | Weak on review | Devote ~1 page to systematic analysis tied to specific questions |
| Gifts/tokens framed as cultural custom | Not allowable budget item | Frame as participant incentives tied to research participation |
| Transcription in budget | Not ordinarily allowed | Seek transcription funding from other sources; note this in budget |
| Advocacy/activism in broader impacts | Outside NSF mission | Frame in terms of scientific infrastructure, public engagement, training |

## Interaction with Dissertation Prospectus

If the user is adapting a dissertation prospectus for NSF DDRIG, key
adaptations:

1. **Reframe for falsifiability.** Committee prospectuses can use interpretive
   framing; NSF requires empirically driven questions subject to falsification.
   This does not mean abandoning qualitative methods — it means framing what
   counts as evidence for or against the theoretical claims.
2. **Add labeled sections.** NSF requires explicitly labeled "Intellectual
   Merit" (or equivalent) and "Broader Impacts" sections. These are not
   optional labels.
3. **Compress to 10 single-spaced pages.** This is tight. Every sentence
   must earn its place.
4. **Add a data analysis plan** (~1 page). Most committee prospectuses
   underspecify analysis. NSF requires systematic explanation.
5. **Add a positionality statement.** Frame as steps toward objectivity,
   not just reflexive positioning.
6. **Add a sample design section.** Explain sampling strategy, justify
   sample size, address bias mitigation.
7. **Write a separate Data Management and Sharing Plan.** This is a
   standalone document, not part of the 10-page project description.
8. **Restructure the budget.** NSF's allowability rules differ significantly
   from Wenner-Gren (especially: no transcription, no gifts-as-custom,
   no salary). Remove disallowed items.
9. **Title format.** Must begin with "Doctoral Dissertation Research:"
10. **PI/co-PI structure.** The advisor submits as PI; the student is co-PI.
    The student writes the proposal.
